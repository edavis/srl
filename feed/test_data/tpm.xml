src="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/assets_c/2013/09/anthony-weiner-pointing-cropped-proto-custom_2.jpg"> <p>A few hours after New York City mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner had <a href="http://livewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/entry/weiner-heckler-made-married-to-arab-comment-video">a heated confrontation with a voter</a> Wednesday, he addressed the situation after an appearance at a senior center in Manhattan.</p> <p>Weiner characterized his behavior as an "appropriate" response to a man who had said "vile and racist things about my wife." He also dismissed the notion he has an anger management problem or is becoming unhinged on the campaign trail.</p> <p>Weiner's confrontation occurred Wednesday afternoon at an appearance in Brooklyn. While he was touring a bakery, a man called him <a href="http://livewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/entry/weiner-heckler-made-married-to-arab-comment-video">a "scumbag" and said Weiner was "married to an Arab,"</a> in reference to Weiner's wife, Huma Abedin, a longtime aide to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton who was born in the United States to Indian and Pakistani parents. </p> <p>"He was saying things within my earshot, but not to me and saying some pretty vile things. And apparently, he didn't expect that I would not stand idly by for it, and I think I put him in his place," Weiner explained to a group of reporters outside of the senior center. "Just because someone is running for office doesn't mean you have an unabridged right to say whatever nasty and vile things you want. ... Part of doing that means that someone is going to respond to you and, by the way, that's the way it's going to be as mayor too. There are going to be people who are going to think that they can say whatever they want and the answer is that they can't." </p> <p>Weiner repeatedly referenced the Jewish new year and said he forgave the man "in the spirit" of the holiday, which begins on Wednesday evening. He also referred to his experience in the House of Representatives and said he was used to confrontations, but felt this situation merited a strong response.</p> <p>"I am a politician. None of what I've seen in this campaign can hold a candle to my advocacy for Obamacare and some of the angry and vicious things people have said to me about that," Weiner explained. "I don't mind people getting in my grill. That's politics. But you know, when you start saying vile and racist things about my wife. When you start saying things, using dirty words and curse words around children, and doing it -- shouting them out. ... It was inappropriate and I think he deserved to be put in his place." </p> <p>Weiner's shouting match with the voter was not his first heated moment of this mayoral campaign. In August, he <a href="http://livewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/entry/aarp-criticizes-anthony-weiner-for-calling-rival-grandpa">got into another intense exchange</a> with Republican candidate George McDonald at a debate. He has also been dogged by stories of his "intensity," including <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/13/nyregion/weiners-record-in-house-intensity-publicity-and-limited-results.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0">allegations he once threw a salad at a wall</a> after getting upset with a staffer during his time in Congress. In light of all these incidents, TPM asked Weiner whether he's concerned he might have an "anger management problem." Weiner referenced the fact Rep. Peter King (R-NY) has accused him of having a "<a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/politico-live/2013/07/king-weiner-not-psychologically-qualified-169345.html">pathological problem</a>," but dismissed the notion he has anger issues.</p> <p>"Hey, listen, you know that's what Peter King thinks. ... I don't see the value as a citizen or as an elected official -- when someone says something outrageous, or does something outrageous, telling them that it's outrageous. Who do you do a favor when you act like everything's normal when someone tries to shut down the consideration of the 9/11 bill on procedural vote after telling you personally that they would not?" Weiner argued. "Who benefits when someone says something racist and you don't -- you treat it as if it's a polite thing to do. Who benefits from that?" </p> <p>Weiner went on to suggest his temperament was a qualification in his mayoral bid.</p> <p>"I think New Yorkers need a leader who is going to express an emotion if it's appropriate. ... If something is outrageous, I'm going to say it's outrageous. And it's puzzling to me about this notion that you're supposed to somehow, well, act as if everything's OK when someone says something biased, or bigoted, or tries to hold someone else down, or tries to deny people their healthcare under the 9/11 bill," said Weiner. "If you want a mayor who's going to pretend every thing's all right when things that are outrageous are happening, don't vote for me. Because when I think something's outrageous, I'm going to say it."</p> <p>Along with his battles on the campaign trail, Weiner's campaign has included <a href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2013/07/anthony-weiner-new-photos-press-conference.php">a sexting scandal</a> that knocked him out of contention in the polls. TPM next asked Weiner about the "general perception" he had become "unhinged" or "unraveled" during the course of the mayor's race.</p> <p>"I don't think that's my perception," Weiner said. "I know that it's a lazy narrative you might want to run with and that's kind of been your stock and trade, so feel free to go with that. But I answered your question, you're free to answer another, but don't characterize someone else as having a perception when you're talking for yourself. That's lazy reporting."</p> <p>TPM responded by explaining it was a characterization that has been made "<a href="http://gothamist.com/2013/08/06/weiner_3.php">throughout</a> <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2013/08/09/video-weiner-finally-starting-to-lose-it/">the</a> <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/07/anthony-weiner-unraveling-94940.html">media</a>." <br /> <br /> "Oh, so you're asking me why the media has an echo chamber about this as you cast your eyes to other members of the media to get their nodding approval," said Weiner. "I can't answer you what other people think. If other people believe like, for example, you and perhaps Peter King both think it's outrageous to stand on the floor of Congress and fight for the 9/11 Healthcare Bill, and when the Republicans use procedural techniques to try to stop people from getting healthcare who are dying, you're supposed to say, 'Oh, the distinguished gentleman. It's very nice to say that.' No. You act outraged, you act angry."</p> <p>Watch a full video of Weiner's remarks below. </p> <div id="rg_player_abd3f6b0-4082-012f-2a8c-12313d00d151-aw94" class="RGvideoPlayer"> <input name="player_uuid" value="abd3f6b0-4082-012f-2a8c-12313d00d151" type="hidden"/> <input name="width" value="620" type="hidden"/> <input name="height" value="414" type="hidden"/> <input name="video_uuid" value="98279f7b-9c28-4b75-a600-05da03944e19" type="hidden"/> <input name="video_guid" value="98279f7b-9c28-4b75-a600-05da03944e19" type="hidden"/> </div> <script src="http://anomaly.realgravity.com/javascripts/app_player.js" defer></script> <script src="http://anomaly.realgravity.com/javascripts/app_player.js" defer></script> <div id="adaptvcompanion" style="display:inline;margin-left:10px;background-color:333333;width:300px;"></div>      <script src="http://anomaly.realgravity.com/javascripts/ads/rg_companion_ad.min.js"></script><img width='1' height='1' src='http://talkingpointsmemo.feedsportal.com/c/34753/f/640424/s/30cfb3d1/sc/7/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><div class='mf-viral'><table border='0'><tr><td valign='middle'><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F09%2Fanthony-weiner-voter-racist.php&t=Weiner+Says+Voter+%27Deserved+To+Be+Put+In+His+Place%27+%28VIDEO%29" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F09%2Fanthony-weiner-voter-racist.php&t=Weiner+Says+Voter+%27Deserved+To+Be+Put+In+His+Place%27+%28VIDEO%29" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F09%2Fanthony-weiner-voter-racist.php&t=Weiner+Says+Voter+%27Deserved+To+Be+Put+In+His+Place%27+%28VIDEO%29" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F09%2Fanthony-weiner-voter-racist.php&t=Weiner+Says+Voter+%27Deserved+To+Be+Put+In+His+Place%27+%28VIDEO%29" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F09%2Fanthony-weiner-voter-racist.php&t=Weiner+Says+Voter+%27Deserved+To+Be+Put+In+His+Place%27+%28VIDEO%29" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png" border="0" /></a></td><td valign='middle'></td></tr></table></div><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173953404264/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30cfb3d1/sc/7/rc/1/rc.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173953404264/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30cfb3d1/sc/7/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173953404264/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30cfb3d1/sc/7/rc/2/rc.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173953404264/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30cfb3d1/sc/7/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173953404264/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30cfb3d1/sc/7/rc/3/rc.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173953404264/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30cfb3d1/sc/7/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173953404264/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30cfb3d1/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173953404264/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30cfb3d1/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/173953404264/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30cfb3d1/a2t.img" border="0"/><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/tpm-news/~4/YkERrfUw5Ec" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://talkingpointsmemo.feedsportal.com/c/34753/f/640424/s/30cfb3d1/sc/7/l/0Ltpmdc0Btalkingpointsmemo0N0C20A130C0A90Canthony0Eweiner0Evoter0Eracist0Bphp/story01.htm</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Wendy Davis Joins A Long Line of Hopeful Texas Democrats</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/tpm-news/~3/PqlBNyzmCgE/story01.htm</link><description>Texas State Sen.

Wendy Davis's (D) meteoric rise to national prominence has left her in a unique position. Not only is she considered a strong candidate to run for governor but she's also considered to be a rising star that Democrats hope could help turn the state blue. The Texas Tribune recently <a href="http://www.texastribune.org/2013/08/27/texas-democrats-wait-davis-/">reported</a> that other Democrats are taking a "wait and see" approach on whether the national attention and money a Davis gubernatorial campaign would bring to those who are eyeing seats. </p> <p>But the story of the next great Democrat to bring change is nothing new for the state of Texas. In fact, a long time ago -- in what now seems like a Texas that's far far away -- there were other Democrats who, like Davis, observers believed would herald in a new era of Democratic dominance. Below is a list of these Democrats who, at one time or another, were seen as the beginning of a new Democratic era in the Lone Star state. </p> <p><div style="float:left; margin:0px 20px 5px 0px"><img src="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/assets_c/2013/09/Castro-Brothers-Together-cropped-proto-custom_6.jpg"></div> <strong>The Castro brothers.</strong> One of the most popular names in Texas politics has been Castro -- as in Rep. Joaquín Castro (D) and his brother, San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro (D). Democrats find the brothers so promising that Julian Castro <a href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/08/meet-julian-castro-the-2012-dnc-keynote-speaker.php">delivered the Democratic National Committee keynote speech</a> in 2012 in Charlotte (President Barack Obama gave the speech in 2004). Joaquín has stayed prominent by <a href="http://livewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/entry/castro-immigration-issue-helps-latinos-sort-good-pols">weighing in on big issues like immigration reform</a>. Either brother could run for a higher office someday, but since Davis's filibuster, the blue Texas spotlight has shifted to shine on Davis.</p> <p><div style="float:left; margin:0px 20px 5px 0px"><img src= "http://talkingpointsmemo.com/assets_c/2013/09/Ann-Richards-Texas-cropped-proto-custom_6.jpg"></div><strong>Ann Richards.</strong> When asked who might be the best comparison to Davis, political observers almost always say former Gov. Ann Richards, who served in Texas' highest office for one term starting in 1991. Richards, like Davis, spent years prior to her time in the governor's mansion in local Democratic politics. Also like other Democrats who rose at a sound-barrier-breaking speed, Richards earned the country's attention when she <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pvrvRT23is">made the keynote address at the 1988 Democratic National Convention</a> as Texas State Treasurer. If Davis runs for governor and wins, Democrats will likely pray that her time in office will outpace Richards' (she lost to George W. Bush in 1994). By the time Richards became governor, Democrats had already begun to lose their iron grip of the state and Republicans soon dominated every statewide election.</p> <p><div style="float:left; margin:0px 20px 5px 0px"><img src= "http://talkingpointsmemo.com/assets_c/2013/09/Dan-Morales-Texas-cropped-proto-custom_6.jpg"></div> <strong>Dan Morales.</strong> During the heyday of the Richards' era, there were a number of politicians Democrats were excited about, but perhaps the one who generated the most buzz was Morales. Morales served as attorney general first under Richards and then under Gov. George W. Bush. He ran for governor himself in 2002 after passing on a challenge against retiring Sen. Phil Gramm (R-TX) but Morales lost in the Democratic primary against businessman Tony Sanchez (who was in turn defeated by current Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R) in the general election). Morales then went on to endorse Perry in the gubernatorial election. In 2003, Morales was <a href="http://www.texasmonthly.com/story/so-whats-truth-about-dan-morales-and-tobacco">indicted</a> for attempting to make hundreds of millions of dollars from legal costs in a settlement with a set of tobacco companies, effectively ending any political desires he may have had left. </p> <p><div style="float:left; margin:0px 20px 5px 0px"><img src= "http://talkingpointsmemo.com/assets_c/2013/09/Bill-White-Texas-cropped-proto-custom_6.jpg"></div><strong>Bill White.</strong> When he was mayor of Houston, Bill White was a hot commodity. He seemed destined for the governor's mansion or perhaps something beyond that. Prior to running the largest city in Texas, White served as United States Deputy Secretary of Energy for then-President Bill Clinton from 1993 to 1995. His mayoral and association with Clinton win gave him the sheen of a Democrat who also could win in the South. White eventually ran for governor against Rick Perry in 2010 and lost by 13 points. <p><div style="float:left; margin:0px 20px 5px 0px"><img src= "http://talkingpointsmemo.com/assets_c/2013/09/Henry-Cisneros-Texas-cropped-proto-custom_6.jpg"></div><p><strong>Henry Cisneros.</strong> In the 1980s, Cisneros became the first Hispanic mayor of an American city when he was elected the chief executive of San Antonio. In 1984, Cisneros was interviewed by Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale (MN) as a possible candidate for vice president. Clinton tapped Cisneros in 1992 to serve as secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Cisneros's political career got <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/cisneros/keystories.htm">mired</a> over an investigation into whether he lied to the FBI about making payments to his former mistress and he left politics. Cisneros then went to the private sector where he started the Cisneros Asset Management Company. Currently, Cisneros serves as one of the co-chairs of the Bipartisan Policy Center's Housing Commission. He also co-chairs the think tank's Immigration Task Force. <p><div style="float:left; margin:0px 20px 5px 0px"><img src= "http://talkingpointsmemo.com/assets_c/2013/09/Ben-Barnes-Texas-cropped-proto-custom_6.jpg"></div><strong>Ben Barnes.</strong> Before serving as lieutenant governor from the late 1960s to the early 1970s, Barnes served in the Texas House of Representatives. He became the the chamber's speaker at the age of 26, making him the youngest politician to hold one of the most powerful political positions in the state since the 1800s. He also was close to President Lyndon Johnson and Texas Gov. John Connally. "Back then, everybody said he's going to be president," Democratic strategist Paul Begala told TPM. In 1971, Barnes was accused of bribery in the <a href="http://blog.chron.com/txpotomac/2010/01/today-in-texas-history-the-sharpstown-scandal-breaks/">Sharpstown scandal</a> along with a number of other politicians but <a href="http://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2004-06-04/213658/">no charges</a> were ever filed against Barnes. Barnes recovered and ran for governor in 1972, but lost and decided to end his career in politics. He eventually went into real estate and became a lobbyist. <p>None of these past great hopes for Texas is a perfect comparison to Davis today. Political strategists and historians stressed to TPM that each of these pols rode a wave of unique political factors -- just as Davis is doing now. </p> <p>"One of the reasons it's hard to find a comparison is Wendy Davis's rise is so rapid," Dr. James Henson, who directs the University of Texas at Austin's Texas Politics Project told TPM. "Ann Richards was, in a lot of ways, kind of a last gasp of something and if Wendy Davis is going to succeed she needs to be seen as the first breath of something new."</p> <p><em>Correction:</em> The original version of this post incorrectly referred to Dan Morales as a former Texas lieutenant governor. In fact, he was attorney general of Texas. We regret the error. </p><img width='1' height='1' src='http://talkingpointsmemo.feedsportal.com/c/34753/f/640424/s/30cc06ee/sc/1/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><div class='mf-viral'><table border='0'><tr><td valign='middle'><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F09%2Ftexas-rising-stars-past.php&t=Wendy+Davis+Joins+A+Long+Line+of+Hopeful+Texas+Democrats" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F09%2Ftexas-rising-stars-past.php&t=Wendy+Davis+Joins+A+Long+Line+of+Hopeful+Texas+Democrats" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F09%2Ftexas-rising-stars-past.php&t=Wendy+Davis+Joins+A+Long+Line+of+Hopeful+Texas+Democrats" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F09%2Ftexas-rising-stars-past.php&t=Wendy+Davis+Joins+A+Long+Line+of+Hopeful+Texas+Democrats" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F09%2Ftexas-rising-stars-past.php&t=Wendy+Davis+Joins+A+Long+Line+of+Hopeful+Texas+Democrats" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png" border="0" /></a></td><td valign='middle'></td></tr></table></div><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/174726563513/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30cc06ee/sc/1/rc/1/rc.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/174726563513/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30cc06ee/sc/1/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/174726563513/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30cc06ee/sc/1/rc/2/rc.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/174726563513/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30cc06ee/sc/1/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/174726563513/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30cc06ee/sc/1/rc/3/rc.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/174726563513/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30cc06ee/sc/1/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/174726563513/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30cc06ee/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/174726563513/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30cc06ee/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/174726563513/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30cc06ee/a2t.img" border="0"/><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/tpm-news/~4/PqlBNyzmCgE" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://talkingpointsmemo.feedsportal.com/c/34753/f/640424/s/30cc06ee/sc/1/l/0Ltpmdc0Btalkingpointsmemo0N0C20A130C0A90Ctexas0Erising0Estars0Epast0Bphp/story01.htm</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>The GOP's Three Escape Routes On Syria</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/tpm-news/~3/D5bZv495Xp0/story01.htm</link><description>Leery Republicans are still feeling their way forward on how to oppose President Obama's action in Syria without paying a political price.

But that doesn't mean rank-and-file Republicans are convinced -- far from it. While GOP lawmakers are mostly keeping their powder dry at this juncture, many are signaling they may oppose the mission to retaliate for the Assad regime's alleged use of chemical weapons.</p> <p>It's only been a few days since Obama dumped some of the responsibility for intervening in Syria into Congress' collective lap. Leery Republicans are still feeling their way forward on how to oppose the president without paying a political price. So far, three rhetorical escape routes have emerged from Republicans looking to justify their opposition -- or possible opposition:</p> <p><strong>1) Obama Already Botched The Mission</strong></p> <p>One school of thought among Republicans is that Obama has already let Syria disintegrate into disaster, and it's unclear if U.S. intervention can accomplish much now. This view appears most popular among 2016 presidential hopefuls. It's politically expedient because it allows them simultaneously to attack Obama while refraining from officially siding with either of the GOP's competing hawkish and isolationist camps.</p> <p>"The President has some work to do to recover from his grave missteps in Syria," Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) said in a statement Tuesday. "He needs to clearly demonstrate that the use of military force would strengthen America's security. I want to hear his case to Congress and to the American people."</p> <p>He wasn't the only GOP presidential aspirant arguing that Obama has blown it.</p> <p>"The choice was made to lead from behind, to watch as this thing unfolded," Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) said Tuesday at a Foreign Relations Committee hearing. "Yes, this is a horrible incident where a thousand people died. But before this incident, 100,000 people died. ... This is a reminder of what happens when we ignore the world -- when we look inward and ignore these problems."</p> <p><strong>2) Obama Isn't Going Far Enough</strong></p> <p>Some Republicans claim Obama is waging a half-hearted battle by opposing U.S. boots on the ground and stopping short of calling for regime change. Certain foreign policy hawks, like Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), want Obama to launch a broader war but have left little room to oppose a limited intervention. But others are testing those waters and are flirting with the theory that it may not be worth supporting a mission unless it topples Assad.</p> <p>"I'm trying to reconcile why if we are going to go in there militarily, if we are going to strike, why not try to do some kind of knockout punch?" Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) said at the Foreign Relations Committee hearing Tuesday. "Is it because we have no faith that there is nobody on the ground, the military rebels -- is it not ready to change, is that the problem?"</p> <p>Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) swiped Obama on the White House lawn after meeting with him Monday, insisting that "the purpose of the military action in Syria should not be to help the president save face. It should not be merely cosmetic." He warned that "the Iranians are marching toward a nuclear weapon" and that "if we're indifferent, if we respond poorly to Assad, I think that gives a green light to the Iranians that we as Americans are really not serious about stopping their nuclear program, which would be a game-changer for the world."</p> <p><strong>3) Obama Can't Be Trusted To Carry It Out</strong></p> <p>Ultraconservative lawmakers are flirting with the theory that Obama cannot be trusted to carry out the Syria mission. The argument was made Tuesday by Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-KS) on Twitter, who invoked Benghazi.</p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Since <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Obama&#38;src=hash">#Obama</a> still refuses to tell us the whole truth about <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Benghazi&#38;src=hash">#Benghazi</a>, why do GOP leaders trust Obama to be truthful about <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Syria&#38;src=hash">#Syria</a>? <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TCOT&#38;src=hash">#TCOT</a></p>&#8212; Cong.

And while most junior Republicans in the House have yet to weigh in, this viewpoint is apparently shaping up to sway numerous GOP lawmakers on the Syria authorization vote.</p> <p>"There's no doubt the president has been extremely reluctant to take action in Syria," reports Byron York of the conservative <a href="http://washingtonexaminer.com/why-many-republicans-wont-support-obama-on-syria-attack/article/2535061">Washington Examiner</a>. "He also showed terrible judgment by painting himself into a corner with his 2012 'red line' comments on chemical weapons. For those reasons, and more, some Republicans will argue that they simply cannot entrust special warmaking powers to a president who they believe is not competent to use them."</p><img width='1' height='1' src='http://talkingpointsmemo.feedsportal.com/c/34753/f/640424/s/30c890f5/sc/20/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><div class='mf-viral'><table border='0'><tr><td valign='middle'><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F09%2Fgop-syria-three-escape-routes.php&t=The+GOP%27s+Three+Escape+Routes+On+Syria" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F09%2Fgop-syria-three-escape-routes.php&t=The+GOP%27s+Three+Escape+Routes+On+Syria" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F09%2Fgop-syria-three-escape-routes.php&t=The+GOP%27s+Three+Escape+Routes+On+Syria" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F09%2Fgop-syria-three-escape-routes.php&t=The+GOP%27s+Three+Escape+Routes+On+Syria" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F09%2Fgop-syria-three-escape-routes.php&t=The+GOP%27s+Three+Escape+Routes+On+Syria" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png" border="0" /></a></td><td valign='middle'></td></tr></table></div><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173953379257/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30c890f5/sc/20/rc/1/rc.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173953379257/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30c890f5/sc/20/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173953379257/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30c890f5/sc/20/rc/2/rc.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173953379257/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30c890f5/sc/20/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173953379257/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30c890f5/sc/20/rc/3/rc.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173953379257/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30c890f5/sc/20/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173953379257/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30c890f5/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173953379257/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30c890f5/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/173953379257/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30c890f5/a2t.img" border="0"/><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/tpm-news/~4/D5bZv495Xp0" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://talkingpointsmemo.feedsportal.com/c/34753/f/640424/s/30c890f5/sc/20/l/0Ltpmdc0Btalkingpointsmemo0N0C20A130C0A90Cgop0Esyria0Ethree0Eescape0Eroutes0Bphp/story01.htm</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Study: Destroying Syria's Chemical Weapons Arsenal Requires Ground Troops</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/tpm-news/~3/Fd_FGNKCono/story01.htm</link><description>The United States would be embarking on a dangerous fool's errand if it attempts to wipe out Syria's chemical weapon capability, according to a new peer-reviewed study by the RAND Corporation, a respected global policy think tank.

Mueller, Jeffrey Martini, and Thomas Hamilton.</p> <p>RAND's findings serve as a reminder as the risks and limitations facing the U.S. as Congress debates whether or not to approve President Barack Obama's call for a limited military strike against regime leader Bashar al-Assad, who according to U.S. intelligence launched a sarin gas attack in the suburbs of Damascus on Aug. 21 that killed hundreds.</p> <p>The study warns of "substantial" collateral damage if the U.S. attempts to destroy Syria's chemical weapons, arguing that locating and striking the relevant facilities would require "very precise and detailed intelligence." It concludes that the prospects for scrapping Syria's chemical weapons via air strikes alone "do not appear promising" and "would require ground forces" in order to have a realistic chance at success.</p> <p>The authors find, however, that air power -- given the right intelligence and execution -- has potential to deter Syria from using chemical weapons in the future and diminish its ability to do so.</p> <p>The RAND conclusions offer a glimpse as to why a limited intervention is what the Obama administration is eying; it opposes boots on the ground and has not called for regime change. Obama's push got a major boost Tuesday with <a href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2013/09/boehner-champions-obama-syria-mission.php">the endorsement of</a> Speaker John Boehner (R-OH). Lawmakers in both parties and chambers have said they want to ensure the mission has a narrow scope and avoid an open-ended commitment.</p> <p>The study elaborates on the risks of intervening in Syria:</p> <blockquote> Because the Assad regime is involved in an existential fight for survival, history suggests that merely punishing it for using chemical weapons is not likely to be an effective deterrent if it perceives the chemical attacks as having great benefit. However, in the present situation, in which the regime appears to have the upper hand even without using chemical weapons, creating the impression that its prospects will be better if it refrains from further chemical weapon attacks is not an implausible objective. [...] <p>Aside from the risk that bombing chemical weapons might cause chemical agents to be released or that attacking aircraft might be lost, the principal risk associated with such attacks is that gradually gnawing away at the Assad regime's chemical weapon stockpiles would create a powerful "use-it-or-lose-it" incentive to relocate chemical munitions to places where they could not be bombed or, worse, employ them while it still had the opportunity to do so. In addition, attacks that damaged chemical weapon storage sites without destroying the weapons would increase the chances of unsecured chemical weapons falling into more-dangerous hands than those of the Syrian regime.</blockquote></p> <p>At a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing Tuesday, Secretary of State John Kerry declared that the President does not want to get "whole hog involved in Syria's civil war" and that "this is a targeted action to deal with Syria's use of chemical weapons."'</p> <p style=" margin: 12px auto 6px auto; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; -x-system-font: none; display: block;"> <a title="View RAND Study on Syria on Scribd" href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/165218698/RAND-Study-on-Syria" style="text-decoration: underline;" >RAND Study on Syria</a></p><iframe class="scribd_iframe_embed" src="//www.scribd.com/embeds/165218698/content?start_page=1&view_mode=scroll&show_recommendations=true" data-auto-height="false" data-aspect-ratio="undefined" scrolling="no" id="doc_98661" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe><img width='1' height='1' src='http://talkingpointsmemo.feedsportal.com/c/34753/f/640424/s/30c890f7/sc/7/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><div class='mf-viral'><table border='0'><tr><td valign='middle'><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F09%2Frand-study-syria-obama.php&t=Study%3A+Destroying+Syria%27s+Chemical+Weapons+Arsenal+Requires+Ground+Troops" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F09%2Frand-study-syria-obama.php&t=Study%3A+Destroying+Syria%27s+Chemical+Weapons+Arsenal+Requires+Ground+Troops" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F09%2Frand-study-syria-obama.php&t=Study%3A+Destroying+Syria%27s+Chemical+Weapons+Arsenal+Requires+Ground+Troops" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F09%2Frand-study-syria-obama.php&t=Study%3A+Destroying+Syria%27s+Chemical+Weapons+Arsenal+Requires+Ground+Troops" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F09%2Frand-study-syria-obama.php&t=Study%3A+Destroying+Syria%27s+Chemical+Weapons+Arsenal+Requires+Ground+Troops" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png" border="0" /></a></td><td valign='middle'></td></tr></table></div><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173953379256/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30c890f7/sc/7/rc/1/rc.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173953379256/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30c890f7/sc/7/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173953379256/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30c890f7/sc/7/rc/2/rc.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173953379256/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30c890f7/sc/7/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173953379256/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30c890f7/sc/7/rc/3/rc.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173953379256/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30c890f7/sc/7/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173953379256/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30c890f7/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173953379256/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30c890f7/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/173953379256/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30c890f7/a2t.img" border="0"/><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/tpm-news/~4/Fd_FGNKCono" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://talkingpointsmemo.feedsportal.com/c/34753/f/640424/s/30c890f7/sc/7/l/0Ltpmdc0Btalkingpointsmemo0N0C20A130C0A90Crand0Estudy0Esyria0Eobama0Bphp/story01.htm</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Syria Vote Comes Down To 'Boots On The Ground'</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/tpm-news/~3/Tz6_lq1foxs/story01.htm</link><description>After the first Capitol Hill test of the White House's push for military action in Syria, one theme emerged Tuesday from Congress: Keep American ground troops out of Syria.

If President Obama is to secure passage of the authorization that he is so publicly advocating for, he'll have to assuage very persistent concerns from the Capitol that they aren't going to be voting to entangle the United States into another quagmire in the Middle East.</p> <p>It's already been a central part of the pitch from President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry, but it's still one of the most common questions that members of Congress are posing to the Obama administration, along with what the fallout of a military strike would be.</p> <p>Aides for both Democrats and Republicans, in both the House and the Senate, told TPM that keeping boots <em>off</em> the ground is either the primary or one of the primary concerns for members in deciding how to vote.</p> <p>It makes sense politically. One Senate Democratic aide pointed to last week's NBC News poll. When asked broadly if they supported military action in Syria, 50 percent of Americans opposed and 42 percent supported. But when told that military action would be limited to missile strikes launched from naval ships, the numbers flipped: 50 percent supported, and 44 percent opposed.</p> <p>"You see a real shift in support when people were told about the scope of activity," the aide said.</p> <p>The Syria situation escalated while Congress members were on recess, and some have even spent their last week of recess holding town halls on the issue. Their last interactions with constituents, and the preoccupation with boots on the ground, will likely linger as they return to Washington.</p> <p>"That's probably what most people get asked about when talking to constituents," a House Democratic aide told TPM.</p> <p>With the ghosts of Iraq and Afghanistan ever present in public comments on Syria, the effort to avoid voting for action that will entrap the United States in another prolonged military action in the Middle East rings true. During Tuesday's three-and-a-half hour Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on Syria, almost every committee member questioned Kerry, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Martin Dempsey about whether the White House would agree to language that restricted the use of ground troops in Syria.</p> <p>As a starting point, several senators chastised the administration for its own proposed resolution, released over the weekend, which they said was too broad.</p> <p>"It's a very open-ended proposal. Why was it proposed in a way that conflicts with statements of no ground troops?" Sen. Tom Udall (D-NM) asked Kerry. "What precise language are you willing to back in terms of showing the American people that we really mean what we say in terms of no boots on the ground?"</p> <p>"I take it very seriously that the language be as precise as possible," Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) told the White House's representatives.</p> <p>Though Obama had repeatedly said that there would be no "boots on the ground" in his earlier statements, Kerry opened that issue up for debate again with a decidedly fumbling response to a similar question from Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) at the beginning of the hearing.</p> <p>"In the event Syria imploded, for instance or in the event there was a threat of a chemical weapons cache falling into the hands of somebody else and it was clearly in the interest of our allies -- all of us, the British, the French, and others. I don't want to take off the table an option that might or might not be available to the President of the United States to secure our country," Kerry said.</p> <p>It wasn't a very popular line with the committee. Ranking member Bob Corker (R-TN), whose staff has been involved with Menendez's in drafting revised language for the resolution, said: "I didn't find that a very appropriate response." Kerry spent the rest of the hearing trying to walk it back.</p> <p>"Let me be very clear now, because I do not want anything coming out of the hearing that leaves any door open to any possibility," Kerry later said. "Let's shut the door now as tight as we can. All I did was raise a hypothetical question about some possibility, and I am thinking out loud on how to protect America's interests, but if you want to know if there is any -- the answer is what ever prohibition clarifies it to Congress, there will not be American boots on the ground with respect to the civil war."</p> <p>The new resolution being drafted by the Corker and Menendez staffs will include language restricting the possibility of U.S. troops setting foot in Syria. Another alternative released Tuesday by two House Democrats, Chris Van Hollen (MD) and Gerald Connolly (VA), has a legally binding stipulation that no grounds troops be deployed, according to the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/van-hollen-connolly-draft-narrow-authorization-of-force-in-syria/2013/09/03/7cbc6b60-14c0-11e3-b182-1b3bb2eb474c_story.html">Washington Post</a>.</p> <p>Corker <a href="http://livewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/entry/corker-we-are-in-agreement-on-syria-resolution">said earlier Tuesday</a> that he was "in agreement" with Menendez and Obama on what a new resolution should look like and indicated it could be released as early as Tuesday night.

Boehner's remarks in favor of intervening to punish the regime's alleged use of chemical weapons dramatically alter the politics in Congress as it gears up for the debate.</p> <p>"The use of chemical weapons is a barbarous act," Boehner told reporters after meeting with the president and congressional leaders at the White House. "This is something that the United States as a country needs to do. I'm going to support the president's call for action. I believe my colleague should support this call for action."</p> <p>"I appreciate the president reaching out to me and my colleagues in the Congress over the last couple of weeks. I also appreciate the president asking the Congress to support him in this action," the Speaker said. His remarks were backed by his deputy, Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-VA), who also announced his support for Obama's mission shortly after the morning meeting at the White House.</p> <p>Boehner's support changes the politics because scores of lawmakers in both parties have remained skeptical of military intervention in Syria despite the Aug. 21 chemical weapons attack in the suburbs of Damascus. Republicans, in particular, are deeply divided between the foreign policy hawks and a growing strain of isolationists within their tent. (Democrats are also split between war-weary progressives and humanitarian interventionists.)</p> <p>This sets up a potentially nasty debate between GOP leaders and conservatives like Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) and Rep. Justin Amash (R-MI), who have been making the case against intervening. The debate will also test the instincts of 2016 presidential contenders like Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) to remain on the opposite side of Obama.</p> <p>Boehner spokesman Michael Steel made clear that while Boehner supports Obama's mission, it remains the President's responsibility to make the case to Americans and members of Congress. "Everyone understands that it is an uphill battle to pass a resolution, and the Speaker expects the White House to provide answers to Members' questions and take the lead on any whipping effort," he said. "All votes authorizing the use of military force are conscience votes for members, and passage will require direct, continuous engagement from the White House."</p> <p>Boehner's announcement was met with immediate pushback from some of the more conservative members of the GOP conference:</p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>.<a href="https://twitter.com/SpeakerBoehner">@SpeakerBoehner</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/GOPLeader">@GOPLeader</a> I just finished 2nd stop of 11 to listen to constituents on <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Syria&#38;src=hash">#Syria</a>.

He has tended not to wade head-first into internal GOP debates, instead preferring to mediate and let his conference arrive at its own conclusion, which he would support. In this case, he and his No. 2 have stuck their necks out in a way that gives them ownership over the President's mission. It's now up to them to make sure GOP members don't block Obama.</p> <p>The White House has launched a full-court press to ensure that the resolution passes. Negotiations are underway in the Senate to revise the language of the draft resolution initially proposed by the White House. Agreement on more limited language could be reached as early as Tuesday evening. The administration is not pushing for regime change and opposes U.S. boots on the ground; it wants to launch targeted military strikes at Bashar al-Assad's facilities in an effort to deter him and other dictators in the present and future from using chemical weapons.</p> <p>Thanks to the GOP leaders' support, ensuring congressional approval of the Syria mission is now Boehner's problem just as much as it is Obama's problem.</p><img width='1' height='1' src='http://talkingpointsmemo.feedsportal.com/c/34753/f/640424/s/30c100e6/sc/7/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><div class='mf-viral'><table border='0'><tr><td valign='middle'><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F09%2Fboehner-champions-obama-syria-mission.php&t=Boehner%27s+Support+For+Striking+Syria+Upends+Hill+Politics" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F09%2Fboehner-champions-obama-syria-mission.php&t=Boehner%27s+Support+For+Striking+Syria+Upends+Hill+Politics" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F09%2Fboehner-champions-obama-syria-mission.php&t=Boehner%27s+Support+For+Striking+Syria+Upends+Hill+Politics" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F09%2Fboehner-champions-obama-syria-mission.php&t=Boehner%27s+Support+For+Striking+Syria+Upends+Hill+Politics" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F09%2Fboehner-champions-obama-syria-mission.php&t=Boehner%27s+Support+For+Striking+Syria+Upends+Hill+Politics" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png" border="0" /></a></td><td valign='middle'></td></tr></table></div><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173608528555/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30c100e6/sc/7/rc/1/rc.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173608528555/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30c100e6/sc/7/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173608528555/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30c100e6/sc/7/rc/2/rc.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173608528555/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30c100e6/sc/7/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173608528555/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30c100e6/sc/7/rc/3/rc.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173608528555/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30c100e6/sc/7/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173608528555/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30c100e6/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173608528555/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30c100e6/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/173608528555/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30c100e6/a2t.img" border="0"/><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/tpm-news/~4/grAhYkLIwgQ" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://talkingpointsmemo.feedsportal.com/c/34753/f/640424/s/30c100e6/sc/7/l/0Ltpmdc0Btalkingpointsmemo0N0C20A130C0A90Cboehner0Echampions0Eobama0Esyria0Emission0Bphp/story01.htm</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Another Round Of Revelations In The McDonnell Scandal</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/tpm-news/~3/N0M1Kr5DTrM/story01.htm</link><description>That drip, drip, drip sound you keep hearing is coming from Virginia, where details about the ongoing federal probe of Gov.

Bob McDonnell (R) continue to appear in the press. </p> <p>Over the weekend, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/gov-mcdonnell-described-as-aware-of-gifts-from-virginia-businessman/2013/08/31/f2739284-0f3e-11e3-85b6-d27422650fd5_story.html">The Washington Post published its latest</a> in a series of indispensable articles about the scandal. In it, the paper reported that McDonnell was aware of the tens of thousands of dollars in gifts and other financial help provided to his family by Virginia businessman Jonnie Williams. The Post's story also revealed several additional gifts Williams gave Virginia's first family, and reported that prosecutors have asked the attorneys for the governor and his wife, Maureen McDonnell, to attempt a second round of discussions by the week of Sept. 15.</p> <p>As in its past stories on the scandal, the Post's latest report relied in large part on anonymous people "familiar with documents and interviews gathered by federal investigators." </p> <p>A rundown of the big news in the piece:</p> <p><strong>1. The Governor Knew About The Gifts</strong></p> <p>The governor was aware of Williams' generosity towards his family during the same period of time that he and his wife took steps to help Williams' company, a struggling dietary supplements company named Star Scientific. Bob McDonnell and his representatives <a href="http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2013/08/maureen_mcdonnell.php">have suggested</a> that Maureen McDonnell kept the governor in the dark about the extent of Williams' gifts. </p> <p>From the Post: </p> <blockquote>The governor could not have been influenced to improperly help the Star Scientific executive, [attorneys for the governor and first lady] asserted, based on gifts he didn't know about at the time. The couple's attorneys told prosecutors that Maureen McDonnell worked to hide Williams's gifts because she feared her husband's disapproval, the people said. </blockquote> <p><strong>2. There Were More Gifts</strong></p> <p>More than $150,000 in gifts and payments from Williams to the McDonnells has been made public since the scandal first made news earlier this year. The Post has added a few more items to the inventory.</p> <p>First, Williams paid for Bob and Maureen McDonnell to fly up and stay on Cape Cod over Labor Day weekend last year. Williams and his wife joined the McDonnells that weekend, as did Johns Hopkins University doctor Paul Ladenson, who has served as a consultant to Star Scientific. Williams also paid more than $7,000 in golf outings and equipment for McDonnell, his twin college-aged sons, and members of his staff. Finally, at a September 2011 fundraiser in Richmond, Va. for the American Cancer Society, Williams put in the winning bid, $15,000, to give Maureen McDonnell a weekend in New York and a tour of the fashion district with the designer designer Alex Garfield. Garfield told the Post that Maureen McDonnell had not claimed her prize. </p> <p><strong>3. Williams Was Expensing Gifts</strong></p> <p>According to sources who spoke with the Post, Williams was reimbursed by Star Scientific for many of the gifts he gave the McDonnells, "a sign that he viewed the gifts as a business expense that would pay dividends to the company." Star Scientific has told investigators that it was not aware, at first, that Williams was using company money to pay for the gifts. </p> <p>It's worth noting here that McDonnell has for weeks been referring to his friendship with Williams in the past tense, and his team has begun <a href="http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2013/08/bob_mcdonnell_turns_on_jonnie_williams.php">actively attacking</a> the businessman. </p> <p>"It is important for citizens to take much of what Mr. Williams says with a grain of salt," Rich Galen, McDonnell's private spokesperson, told the Post.</p> <p><strong>4. Investigation Has Hit Delays</strong></p> <p>The timing for filing any charges in the probe is being complicated by Virginia's looming Election Day. Prosecutors do not want the perception that their work influences the results of the gubernatorial contest between Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli (R) and former Democratic National Committee chairman Terry McAuliffe. From the Post:</p> <blockquote>What had been an unusually fast-paced investigation has hit some delays as prosecutors consider the evidence, including the governor's account and new information, several people familiar with the probe say. </blockquote><img width='1' height='1' src='http://talkingpointsmemo.feedsportal.com/c/34753/f/640424/s/30c08621/sc/1/mf.gif' border='0'/><br

But the battles lines are emerging. Here are, broadly speaking, the key foreign policy factions on the Hill which will fight to have their voices heard on whether to back President Obama in punishing Syria's regime for allegedly using chemical weapons against its own people:<br /> </p> <p><strong>Pro-Interventionist Republican Hawks</strong></p> <p>A vocal segment of the Republican Party, foreign policy hawks believe it is role of the United States, as the sole surviving superpower, to use its military might to stamp out brutal tyrants and prevent the world from spiraling into Hobbesian mayhem. This faction of the GOP reigned supreme during the post-9/11 Bush era but has lost some of its influence in the wake of the Iraq war and the election of Obama.</p> <p>Their rationale for intervening in Syria: Bashar al-Assad's regime must be overthrown for terrorizing and mass-murdering his own people, for threatening U.S. allies and interests in the region, and for flouting an international norm not to use chemical weapons.</p> <p>"We believe President Obama is correct that the Assad regime's use of chemical weapons requires a military response by the United States and our friends and allies," Sens. John McCain (R-AZ) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC), the leading foreign policy hawks in Congress, said in a joint statement Saturday. But they wanted Obama to launch a broader intervention, calling on him to devise "an overall strategy that can change the momentum on the battlefield, achieve the President's stated goal of Assad's removal from power, and bring an end to this conflict, which is a growing threat to our national security interests."</p> <p><strong>Liberal Humanitarian Interventionists</strong></p> <p>A faction of liberals has long supported limited, targeted U.S. interventions in war-torn places to advance humanitarian goals. And various Democrats, including the party's congressional leadership, see the Syria mission in this light: a move to stand up for an oppressed people against a mass-murdering tyrant who has crossed a red line by, according to U.S. intelligence, employing chemical weapons to kill his own people.</p> <p>It is this thinking that most closely resembles President Obama's case for intervening. He doesn't want regime change; he opposes U.S. boots on the ground. But according to this philosophy, deterring current and future tyrants from ever using chemical weapons is a vital humanitarian -- and national security -- goal that merits U.S. intervention in the war-ravaged Syria. (A similar philosophy incubated the Clinton-led U.S. intervention in Kosovo.)</p> <p>"This attack is an assault on human dignity," President Obama said in a Saturday speech televised around the world. "It also presents a serious danger to our national security. It risks making a mockery of the global prohibition on the use of chemical weapons. ... It could lead to escalating use of chemical weapons, or their proliferation to terrorist groups who would do our people harm. In a world with many dangers, this menace must be confronted."</p> <p><strong>War-Weary Conservative Isolationists</strong></p> <p>Isolationist sentiments are flourishing in key segments of the conservative movement and are poised to play a key role in the debate over Syria. This philosophy has long been an undercurrent in the GOP, waxing and waning over different eras, and has made a comeback since the failures of the Iraq War and more so since the election of a Democratic president, which made Republicans freer to express their war-weariness.</p> <p>This school of thought, led today by Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) and Rep. Justin Amash (R-MI), says it's not the responsibility of the United States to fix problems in other countries or get involved in international conflicts unless doing so is absolutely critical to national security. Its proponents see the world as an immensely complex, dangerous place that the U.S. cannot and should not try to fix with its military might.</p> <p>"I think it's a mistake to get involved in the Syrian civil war," Paul said Sunday on <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/09/01/what-the-potential-2016-presidential-candidates-think-about-syria/?tid=pm_politics_pop">NBC News</a>. "I think all of the bad things you can imagine are more likely if we get involved in the Syrian civil war." He added Monday on <a href="https://twitter.com/senrandpaul/status/374520716961804288">Twitter</a>: "When we fight, we fight because we have to and we fight to win. I'm not sending my son, your son or anyone else's son to fight for stalemate."</p> <p><strong>Anti-War Progressive Democrats</strong></p> <p>They're not exactly pacifists, but a significant segment of the Democratic Party rejects the view that the answer to violence is more violence. Unless war clearly threatens U.S. interests, as in the case of World War II, these lawmakers are inclined to oppose military intervention. And they're plainly unconvinced that an attack on Syria meets that standard.</p> <p>"We are not the world's policemen. That is not our responsibility," Rep. Alan Grayson (D-FL) told <a href="http://thelead.blogs.cnn.com/2013/08/29/rep-grayson-u-s-strike-on-syria-we-are-not-the-worlds-policeman/">CNN</a> late last week. "I don't know where we got this odd notion that every time we see something bad happen in the world, we should bomb it."</p> <p>This segment of the Democratic Party was marginalized in the aftermath of 9/11 but rose up again when Iraq descended into chaos. It saw vindication as the public concluded that the Iraq War was a mistake. Some Democrats sympathetic to this philosophy have been less aggressive about it in recent years, in deference to President Obama, but the school of thought remains strong among the liberal base, which may influence congressional Democrats.<br /> </p><img width='1' height='1' src='http://talkingpointsmemo.feedsportal.com/c/34753/f/640424/s/30bbe8ac/sc/7/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><div class='mf-viral'><table border='0'><tr><td valign='middle'><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F09%2Ffour-foreign-policy-factions-syria.php&t=The+Four+Major+Foreign+Policy+Factions+On+Syria" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F09%2Ffour-foreign-policy-factions-syria.php&t=The+Four+Major+Foreign+Policy+Factions+On+Syria" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F09%2Ffour-foreign-policy-factions-syria.php&t=The+Four+Major+Foreign+Policy+Factions+On+Syria" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F09%2Ffour-foreign-policy-factions-syria.php&t=The+Four+Major+Foreign+Policy+Factions+On+Syria" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F09%2Ffour-foreign-policy-factions-syria.php&t=The+Four+Major+Foreign+Policy+Factions+On+Syria" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png" border="0" /></a></td><td valign='middle'></td></tr></table></div><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173608512788/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30bbe8ac/sc/7/rc/1/rc.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173608512788/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30bbe8ac/sc/7/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173608512788/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30bbe8ac/sc/7/rc/2/rc.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173608512788/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30bbe8ac/sc/7/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173608512788/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30bbe8ac/sc/7/rc/3/rc.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173608512788/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30bbe8ac/sc/7/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173608512788/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30bbe8ac/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173608512788/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30bbe8ac/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/173608512788/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30bbe8ac/a2t.img" border="0"/><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/tpm-news/~4/TgLsHCjQ2Ys" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://talkingpointsmemo.feedsportal.com/c/34753/f/640424/s/30bbe8ac/sc/7/l/0Ltpmdc0Btalkingpointsmemo0N0C20A130C0A90Cfour0Eforeign0Epolicy0Efactions0Esyria0Bphp/story01.htm</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Smackdown: Governors Take The Battle Over Business Public</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/tpm-news/~3/GfH2YU9BJls/story01.htm</link><description>Texas Gov.

Rick Perry (R) and Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon (D) are in what may be the most heated spat between one governor trying to poach companies from the other governor's state. </p> <p>In the last week of August, Perry aired radio ads and made an appearance in Missouri, apparently to capitalize on Nixon's decision to veto a bill halving the state's corporate tax rate lowering its income tax. </p> <p>"Vetoing a tax cut is the same thing as raising your taxes. But there is a state where businesses flourish and jobs are created: Texas," Perry said in one of the ads. </p> <p>Perry's reported $200,000 advertising campaign, which includes both TV and radio ads, argues that Texas is straight-up better than Missouri thanks to its lack of income tax and pro-small business policies.</p> <p>Nixon hasn't taken Perry's criticism lying down. He's accused the Texas governor and former presidential candidate of job poaching and aired his own ads fighting back. </p> <p>"Make no mistake, our businesses aren't going to Texas and here's why," Nixon explained in the ad, pointing to Missouri's low sales and property taxes, high graduation rates, low unemployment rate and better standardized test scores.</p> <p>"And unlike Texas, Missouri has a perfect Triple-A credit rating," digging at <a href="http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2013/aug/30/jay-nixon/give-missouri-governor-comparison-credit-ratings-m/">Standard & Poor's rating Texas at AA+</a>. </p> <p>Perry brushed off Nixon's criticism <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/gov-perry-disputes-job-poacher-charge-in-advance-of-missouri/article_a7c4fda4-23df-5cea-9a91-7bb52d009cb2.html">in an interview</a> with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch on Thursday. "That's the easy out, to say we're stealing jobs, poaching jobs, poaching jobs," Perry said. "We ought to be talking about how competition is good for states. Whether you're an athlete or a businessperson or a governor, competition is good."</p> <p>Governors competing to get and retain businesses is a good thing, Perry argued. "I'm a huge believer in competition," he continued to the St. Louis newspaper. "It will make not only Missouri stronger, it will make this country stronger." </p> <p>This isn't the first time governors have sought to woo business from another state, but they usually don't take the message quite so public. Perry himself has made a habit of personally appealing to businesses in states like Illinois, California and New York in the hopes of bringing a few back to Texas. And governors from Florida, New Jersey, South Carolina, Washington, Delaware, Indiana and Wisconsin have all reached out to businesses in other states touting the allure of their home states. Oftentimes the argument centers on lower taxes and a better business climate. </p> <p>Recently, Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) won the anger of Kentucky Gov. Steven Beshear (D) for trying to pull business from his state. At one point, in June, Scott sent letters to Kentucky businesses urging them to buy a "one way" ticket to Florida where the state's tax and business environments, Scott argued, are more accommodating. Earlier in August the Kentucky governor had finally had enough and <a href="http://baynews9.com/content/news/baynews9/news/article.html/content/news/articles/bn9/2013/8/21/kentucky_governor_ri.html">sent</a> Scott a letter dubbing Scott's efforts "crude."</p> <p>"Although I am well aware of the competitive environment that is inevitable in economic development, I admit that I was shocked and dismayed at your crude method of recruitment," Beshear wrote. </p> <p>Like Perry, Scott had no regrets. "My job is to let everyone know how well we're doing and I'm going to continue to do that," Scott said. </p> <p>The fight even stretches to the Midwest, where Minnesota state Rep. Joe Atkins, a member of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, held an interim House Commerce Committee panel on Thursday to stop Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) from spreading anti-Minnesota "propaganda" while trying to bring businesses to the Badger State. Walker, like Perry, is trying to capitalize on a $2 billion tax increased passed in the state in 2012. </p> <p>"It's not about Wisconsin bashing," Atkins <a href="http://blogs.mprnews.org/capitol-view/2013/08/minnesota-house-panel-tries-to-counter-wisconsin-propaganda/">told</a> Minnesota Public Radio. "But whenever you start comparing the two states, particularly on sports but also economically, there's this exaggeration and propaganda and all of that tends to occur."</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, a number of governors have <a href="http://www.governing.com/blogs/view/gov-conservatives-target-illinois-businesses-for-poaching.html">descended</a> on Illinois in the past few years with the hopes of luring businesses away from the state while it suffers from serious budgetary problems. Perry, Scott, and Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels (R) have all made personal appeals to tempt major Illinois businesses with the promise of less burdensome taxes. </p> <p>Even if businesses don't switch states, there are benefits for the governors making the offer. Governors can gain credibility by being seen as doing anything and everything to bring in new business and jobs, Brookings Institution Senior Fellow Mark Muro told TPM on Friday. </p> <p>"There's no more attractive moment for the governor than presence at the creation of jobs. So if the governor is simply out there, seeking to rest firms and relocate them to the state then he looks like an activist going to bat for the state," Muro said. "And if he secures a relocation it's all for the better."</p> <p>Tax rates, like what Perry and Scott have been flaunting, are oftentimes the favored incentive for governors hoping to lure new business from elsewhere. Actually, Muro said, there is little research to suggest that a business actually sees larger profits or more job creation from moving to a state with a lower tax rate. </p> <p>"That one's a particularly fatuous offering because many relocation studies notice that taxes often aren't a huge part of the operating budget so that that is often the peripheral consideration," Muro said. </p> <p>Muro pointed to <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2011/1/19%20clusters%20muro/0119_clusters_muro.pdf">a study he did with Kenan Fikri, also of Brookings</a>, which found that states are better off trying to foster homegrown businesses rather than through bringing in business from other states. </p> <p>"The best way to create more jobs in a state is to grow them at home, rather than poach them from elsewhere," the report said. "Some 95 percent of all job gains in a year in an average state come from the expansion of existing businesses or the birth of new establishments."</p><img width='1' height='1' src='http://talkingpointsmemo.feedsportal.com/c/34753/f/640424/s/30bbe8b0/sc/1/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><div class='mf-viral'><table border='0'><tr><td valign='middle'><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F09%2Fsmackdown-governors-take-the-battle-over-business-public.php&t=Smackdown%3A+Governors+Take+The+Battle+Over+Business+Public" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F09%2Fsmackdown-governors-take-the-battle-over-business-public.php&t=Smackdown%3A+Governors+Take+The+Battle+Over+Business+Public" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F09%2Fsmackdown-governors-take-the-battle-over-business-public.php&t=Smackdown%3A+Governors+Take+The+Battle+Over+Business+Public" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F09%2Fsmackdown-governors-take-the-battle-over-business-public.php&t=Smackdown%3A+Governors+Take+The+Battle+Over+Business+Public" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F09%2Fsmackdown-governors-take-the-battle-over-business-public.php&t=Smackdown%3A+Governors+Take+The+Battle+Over+Business+Public" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png" border="0" /></a></td><td valign='middle'></td></tr></table></div><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173608512787/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30bbe8b0/sc/1/rc/1/rc.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173608512787/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30bbe8b0/sc/1/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173608512787/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30bbe8b0/sc/1/rc/2/rc.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173608512787/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30bbe8b0/sc/1/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173608512787/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30bbe8b0/sc/1/rc/3/rc.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173608512787/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30bbe8b0/sc/1/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173608512787/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30bbe8b0/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173608512787/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30bbe8b0/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/173608512787/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30bbe8b0/a2t.img" border="0"/><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/tpm-news/~4/GfH2YU9BJls" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://talkingpointsmemo.feedsportal.com/c/34753/f/640424/s/30bbe8b0/sc/1/l/0Ltpmdc0Btalkingpointsmemo0N0C20A130C0A90Csmackdown0Egovernors0Etake0Ethe0Ebattle0Eover0Ebusiness0Epublic0Bphp/story01.htm</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Facebook Photos Seem To Show The Violent Life Of Suriname's Ruling Family</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/tpm-news/~3/iToCWE422aM/story01.htm</link><description>Dino Bouterse, the son of Suriname's president is currently in Manhattan awaiting trial on charges he brandished a rocket launcher while working to smuggle cocaine into the United States.

The pictures also include something more sinister -- multiple images of heavy weaponry and drug dealing paraphernalia.&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='http://talkingpointsmemo.feedsportal.com/c/34753/f/640424/s/30b65095/sc/21/mf.gif' border='0'/&gt;&lt;br clear='all'/&gt;&lt;div class='mf-viral'&gt;&lt;table border='0'&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign='middle'&gt;&lt;a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F09%2Ffacebook-photos-violent-life-suriname-bouterse.php&amp;t=Facebook+Photos+Seem+To+Show+The+Violent+Life+Of+Suriname%27s+Ruling+Family" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F09%2Ffacebook-photos-violent-life-suriname-bouterse.php&amp;t=Facebook+Photos+Seem+To+Show+The+Violent+Life+Of+Suriname%27s+Ruling+Family" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F09%2Ffacebook-photos-violent-life-suriname-bouterse.php&amp;t=Facebook+Photos+Seem+To+Show+The+Violent+Life+Of+Suriname%27s+Ruling+Family" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F09%2Ffacebook-photos-violent-life-suriname-bouterse.php&amp;t=Facebook+Photos+Seem+To+Show+The+Violent+Life+Of+Suriname%27s+Ruling+Family" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F09%2Ffacebook-photos-violent-life-suriname-bouterse.php&amp;t=Facebook+Photos+Seem+To+Show+The+Violent+Life+Of+Suriname%27s+Ruling+Family" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign='middle'&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173953312591/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30b65095/sc/21/rc/1/rc.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173953312591/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30b65095/sc/21/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173953312591/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30b65095/sc/21/rc/2/rc.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173953312591/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30b65095/sc/21/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173953312591/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30b65095/sc/21/rc/3/rc.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173953312591/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30b65095/sc/21/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173953312591/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30b65095/a2.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173953312591/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30b65095/a2.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/173953312591/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30b65095/a2t.img" border="0"/&gt;</description><category domain="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category">Desi Bouterse</category><category domain="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category">Foreign Affairs</category><category domain="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category">Dino Bouterse</category><category domain="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category">Drugs</category><category domain="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category">Crime</category><pubDate>Tue, 03 Sep 2013 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com,2013://9075.409877</guid><dc:creator>Hunter Walker</dc:creator><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/assets_c/2013/09/bouterse-feature-pic-cropped-proto-custom_2.jpg"> <p>The son of Suriname's president is currently in Manhattan awaiting trial on charges he brandished a rocket launcher while working to smuggle cocaine into the United States. Dino Bouterse, whose strongman father, Desi, has been accused of allegedly murdering political rivals and also trafficking drugs, was arrested in Panama on Aug. 29, according to U.S. authorities. He was subsequently turned over to the U.S. and brought to Manhattan, where he appeared in court last Friday and <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/feds-son-suriname-prez-coke-smuggler-article-1.1441661">pleaded</a> not guilty. </p> <p>Facebook profiles examined by TPM since Dino Bouterse's arrest that appear to belong to him and his relatives show the opulent and violent lifestyle of Suriname's ruling family. Photos on these Facebook pages include shots of luxury vacations, fancy homes, cars, and "selfies" showing off jewelry and designer clothing. The pictures also include something more sinister -- multiple images of heavy weaponry and drug dealing paraphernalia.</p> <p>The two-count indictment filed against Dino Bouterse and his co-defendant Edmund Quincy Muntslag in a federal court in Manhattan Aug. 20 accuses Dino Bouterse of having "brandished firearms" in the furtherance of his "narcotics conspiracy" including "a Light-Antitank Weapon, which is a launcher containing a rocket, and pistols." The indictment also accuses Dino Bouterse of having "caused a suitcase containing 10 kilograms of cocaine to be transported from Suriname to the Caribbean on board a commercial flight." Muntslag is accused of having "traveled to an airport in Suriname in order to make arrangements for the transport" of the 10 kilograms of cocaine. Both men are accused of conspiring with "others known and unknown" from at least December 2011 up until last month to import cocaine "into the United States from a place outside thereof." </p> <p>Dino Bouterse's court-appointed attorney, Christopher Flood, put off a request for bail and Bouterse will be held until his next hearing, which is set for Sept. 9. Neither Flood or Suriname's mission to the UN immediately responded to a request for comment on this story.</p> <p>The charges against Dino Bouterse aren't the first allegations of drug trafficking made against him and his family. In 2005, Dino Bouterse was <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/2005-08-11-dictator-son-sentenced_x.htm">convicted in Suriname</a> of leading a "ring that trafficked in cocaine, illegal arms and stolen luxury cars." He was released from prison in 2008. </p> <p>Desi Bouterse first took power in Suriname in 1980 when he led a military coup. The military dictatorship remained in power until about 1988. In 1999, a court in the Hague <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/17/world/world-briefing.html">convicted Desi Bouterse</a> in absentia for allegedly leading an international cocaine cartel. France also <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/03/world/americas/03suriname.html?_r=0">has a warrant out on Desi Bouterse</a> on international drug smuggling charges, and U.S. diplomatic cables released by Wikileaks accused him of narcotics trafficking. In Suriname, Desi Bouterse also faces charges for allegedly killing 15 of his political rivals in 1982. That case is still ongoing. </p> <p>In spite of his various legal woes, Desi Bouterse was elected to lead Suriname again by the parliament in 2010. Almost a year later, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/03/world/americas/03suriname.html?_r=0">a New York Times report</a> noted Desi Bouterse's election spurred "fears of a possible return to the time when Suriname, once a magnet for Western mercenaries and Colombian drug cartels, was renowned for its openness to criminal enterprise."</p> <p>It is difficult to confirm with complete certainty whether the Facebook profiles that seemingly belong to Dino Bouterse and his family members are legitimate. However, there are many indications they are genuine. </p> <p>The Facebook page <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dino.bouterse">identified as belonging to Dino Bouterse</a> contains multiple pictures where his face is clearly visible that match other known photos. One picture <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=221356124585761&set=pb.100001341258045.-2207520000.1378146625.&type=3&theater">shows his father</a> the president standing behind President Barack Obama at an event. </p> <p>Other pages connected to Dino Bouterse's profile also seem to support its legitimacy. These include the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ndp.nationaledemocratischepartij?fref=pb&hc_location=friends_tab">official Facebook profile</a> of President Desi Bouterse's political party, Nationale Democratische partij. Other "friends" of the profile identified as Dino Bouterse's include <a href="https://www.facebook.com/melvin.bouva">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/andre.misiekaba">accounts</a> seemingly belonging to NDP members of Suriname's parliament. The pages seemingly belonging to the members of Parliament contain many pictures that match their official photos and include a mix of both personal and official shots. </p> <p>Comments posted on photos that appear on the Dino Bouterse Facebook page also refer to him as the son of the president. </p> <p>"Happybirth day with daddy boy enjoy it and take care of him our President of Suriname," <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=386233768097995&set=a.123044011083640.23353.100001341258045&type=1&comment_id=933480&offset=0&total_comments=37">reads one comment</a> posted on the Dino Bouterse page. </p> <p>The Dino Bouterse Facebook profile is also connected to multiple others bearing the surname of his co-defendant, Muntslag. It is also connected to at least ten profiles with the Bouterse surname. These apparent family members include a profile for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jenai.bouterse">Jen-ai Bouterse</a>, who is listed on the page as Dino Bouterse's sister. There is little information about President Bouterse's extended family online, however multiple local forums describe him as having a daughter named Jen-ai. The 318 photos posted on Jen-ai's Facebook page all bear a resemblance to a <a href="http://www.waterkant.net/suriname/newspictures/?showimage=1814">picture of her posted on a Surinamese news site</a>. On the Jen-ai Bouterse Facebook page there is also a picture that appears to show President Desi Bouterse's wife, Ingrid. That photo <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1580599709881&set=pb.1082330846.-2207520000.1378150757.&type=3&theater">was captioned "Mamsje"</a> and multiple commenters refer to it as depicting the "first lady." If the Dino and Jen-ai Bouterse profiles are fake, it would be a hoax involving an extensive network of profiles and hundreds of photos posted over the course of at least three years. </p> <p>In addition to Jen-ai Bouterse, the Dino Bouterse profile is connected to at least ten other Bouterses. Though the only weapon depicted in the five photos visible on Dino Bouterse's page appears to be a paintball gun, several of the other Bouterses on his friends list display far more fearsome weaponry. One Facebook friend of Dino's, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bouterse.patrick.3">Patrick Bouterse</a> (relation unknown), has several photos showing him and others carrying machine guns. In one picture, Patrick Bouterse is shown seemingly pointing a large gun at another man who he is grabbing by the neck (pictured above). Another shot shows a man brandishing what seems to be an AK-47 and wearing a dark skeleton mask. The circumstances of the photos are not clear. Along with the shots of guns, Patrick Bouterse's Facebook photos include <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=129282010592114&set=pb.100005309463617.-2207520000.1378136667.&type=3&theater">a picture that shows common drug trafficking equipment</a>: electronic scales and a cash-counting machine. In addition to the shots of weapons, many of the Bouterses' Facebook profiles include pictures of them showing off fancy jewelry and cars. </p> <p>TPM attempted to send messages to Patrick Bouterse and all the other Facebook users referenced in this post. None of them immediately responded although Patrick Bouterse accepted a friend request from TPM. We were unable to communicate with the Dino Bouterse Facebook page as it does not accept messages from users who are not already friends. </p> <p>View some of the photos posted by the Bouterses on Facebook below. </p> <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/images/dino-bouterse.jpg" width="320" class="mt-image-left" /></div> The main profile photo on the Dino Bouterse Facebook page. <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/images/patrick-bouterse.jpg" width="600" class="mt-image-left" /></div> A photo from a Facebook page connected to Dino's and listed as belonging to Patrick Bouterse. <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/images/patrick-bouterse-fingers.jpg" width="448" class="mt-image-left" /></div> Another picture from Patrick Bouterse's page. <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/images/ingrid-bouterse-from-jen-ai.jpg" width="600" class="mt-image-left" /></div> Photo from the Jen-ai Bouterse Facebook page that appears to show President Desi Bouterse's wife, Ingrid. <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/images/patrick-bouterse-paraphenalia.jpg" width="600" class="mt-image-left" /></div> A picture that seems to show scales and a cash counting machine from the Patrick Bouterse Facebook page. <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/images/bouterse-car.jpg" width="600" class="mt-image-left" /></div> The interior of a Lexus seen on the Patrick Bouterse Facebook page. <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/images/stephanie-bouterse.jpg" width="600" class="mt-image-left" /></div> A photo of an armed woman from a Facebook page connected to Dino's and listed as belonging to Stephanie Bouterse. <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/images/patrick-bouterse2.jpg" width="600" class="mt-image-left" /></div> A picture from Patrick Bouterse's Facebook page. <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/images/ralph-bouterse.jpg" width="533" class="mt-image-left" /></div> Photo showing a gun from a Facebook friend of Dino Bouterse named Ralph Bouterse. <p>View the full indictment against Dino Bouterse below. </p> <p style=" margin: 12px auto 6px auto; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; -x-system-font: none; display: block;"> <a title="View Indictment: USA v.

Those who join will be accredited members of law enforcement. They also will be able to create databases, have PowerPoint meetings and search for other members via name, topics and interests.</p> <p>"This is a big void that needed to be filled," Bratton said. "Our intent is to have officers locate their counterparts and closely interact with each other on a number of topics such as gangs and counterterrorism as well as share their best practices and strategies."</p> <p>No stranger to meshing technology with crime-fighting, Bratton is widely credited with co-creating Compstat, the innovative crime-mapping system used in New York, Los Angeles and several other major cities. Compstat uses computer data to direct police to specific high-crime areas.</p> <p>Police in San Francisco credit the system with helping that city recently reach near record-low crime levels.</p> <p>Bratton said BlueLine was conceived earlier this year and created by his New York-based venture capitalist-backed startup, Bratton Technologies, after hearing for years that fellow officers didn't have a safe network to share information with each other.</p> <p>BlueLine is currently being beta-tested among 100 officers within the Los Angeles Police and L.A. County Sheriff's departments and the University of Southern California's campus police.</p> <p>While initial reports have compared BlueLine to Facebook, company officials say it will more closely resemble popular social media business-oriented sites like LinkedIn. BlueLine will also allow companies who sell products geared for law enforcement to market to the more than 17,000 agencies the network hopes to lure.</p> <p>"Our focus is to have a walled community where you're verified and authenticated, so you have a safe form of communication with law enforcement, analysts and administrators," said David Riker, Bratton Technologies' president.</p> <p>That wall of security is extremely important, said longtime Los Angeles Police Capt. Sean Malinowski, who has a group of officers testing BlueLine.</p> <p>"We're already seeing a lot of potential with it," Malinowski said. "This is not a traditional 'social media site,' even though you can share files, photos and stuff. It's really specific to the subject matter and expertise that officers want to divulge with each other."</p> <p>Malinowski said BlueLine is long overdue.</p> <p>"That's the thing with innovations. You are always asking questions like, 'Why didn't we have this already?'" Malinowski said.</p> <p>However, Malinowski said most officers have some safety and privacy concerns using social media sites due to the dangers associated with their jobs.</p> <p>"They try not to be as traceable because there are threats made against officers all of the time," said Malinowski, who is also married to a police officer. "You try not to be paranoid about it, but it does cross your mind."</p> <p>BlueLine will require multiple verifications for members of law enforcement to join and enter the network, Weiss said. He added that the platform will be housed in a secure data center that is compliant by the U.S. Dept. of Defense and the FBI's Criminal Justice Information Services.</p> <p>Also, Weiss said BlueLine will not be a venue where law enforcement can share information about specific criminal cases with each other.</p> <p>BlueLine, however, will join the ranks of other law enforcement resource/information-sharing sites, including PoliceOne. BlueLine's emergence also comes as police departments -- many shrinking in manpower due to budget cuts -- have begun experimenting with social media, according to a report by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Police Executive Research Forum, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank for police chiefs.</p> <p>The joint study released in May noted that in a recent survey of 800 law enforcement agencies, 88 percent reported using social media ranging from preventing crime, community policing to investigations and intelligence gathering, but only 49 percent had a social media policy.</p> <p>"I think we're just on the front-end of understanding how social media can help, especially during a crisis," said Chuck Wexler, the Police Executive Research Forum's executive director. "I don't think we've fully recognized its full potential."</p> <p><br /> Copyright 2013 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

src="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/assets_c/2013/09/white-house-obama-situation-room-syria-cropped-proto-custom_2.jpg"> <p>With the politics complicated and the country war-weary, President Barack Obama faces a heavy lift in winning congressional authorization to enforce his "red line" and launch a military response to Syria's alleged use of chemical weapons.</p> <p>The Senate will begin hearings on Tuesday and plans to vote on authorization the week of Sept. 9. The House is poised to consider a measure the same week. Obama has already begun lobbying lawmakers in support of the resolution. He <a href="http://livewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/entry/obama-to-discuss-syria-with-mccain-graham">plans to meet</a> Monday with Sens. John McCain (R-AZ) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC) -- both strong advocates for intervening in the Syria civil war to assist the rebellion -- to discuss the issue.</p> <p>Early indications are that lawmakers are open to supporting the effort but aren't yet persuaded. The Democratic-led Senate is likely to be a less difficult sell than the often-erratic, unpredictable Republican-controlled House.</p> <p>The partisan fault lines are unusually scrambled, both parties full of members for and against military action as punishment against the regime of Bashar al-Assad for what the administration says was a sarin gas attack in the suburbs of Damascus on Aug. 21. Many Democrats and Republicans want more clarity from the White House on the nature of the military response and have sought a resolution that is limited and not open-ended. Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT) said the White House resolution would be amended in the upper chamber, according to <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/09/john-kerry-syria-case-is-building-96138.html">Politico</a>.</p> <p>Republicans are deeply divided between pro-intervention hawks and a growing chorus of isolationists. The internal GOP fight is already heated, with Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) leading the opposition and Rep. Peter King (R-NY) <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/01/peter-king-isolationist-gop_n_3852286.html">saying</a> the "isolationist wing" was "damaging to the party and to our nation."</p> <p>While Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) are supportive of President Obama's call for action, Democrats in general are wary of getting mired in yet another Middle East conflict like Afghanistan or Iraq. They're more likely to be supportive if they're persuaded that the Syria mission will more closely resemble the limited late-1990s U.S. intervention in Kosovo. </p> <p>House Republicans in particular face a variety of competing pressures. On the one hand is historical deference to the executive branch on matters of war and U.S. credibility in vowing not to let al-Assad get away with alleged use of chemical weapons. Forces working against the mission include the public's skepticism, opposition from the GOP's rising isolationist faction, and conservatives' distrust of virtually anything President Obama does.</p> <p>Rep. Tom Cole (R-OK), a deputy majority whip and close ally of Speaker John Boehner (R-OH), warned that the administration had "better make a whale of a case or I think they're very much in danger, certainly in the House, of losing this" vote, according to the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/world/middleeast/la-fg-syria-congress-20130902,0,6203009.story">Los Angeles Times</a>.</p> <p>"The President is going to have to make the case to Congress, and -- more importantly -- the American people, if he wants this resolution to pass," a House Republican leadership aide told TPM. "And the White House is going to have to answer the serious questions raised by the Speaker and others."</p> <p>While it is difficult to envision Obama acting without congressional approval, the administration is leaving that door open. Secretary of State John Kerry said Sunday that while the country would be stronger if Congress OKs the mission, the President "<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/01/syria-crisis-reaction-obama-decision-military-action">has the right</a>" to act regardless.</p><img width='1' height='1'

who collected samples from last week's alleged chemical weapons strike outside Damascus left Syria for the Netherlands on Saturday, hours after President Barack Obama said he is weighing "limited and narrow" action against the Syrian regime his administration blames for the attack.</p> <p>In Moscow, Russian President Vladimir Putin urged Obama not to rush into a decision. The Russian leader said he was convinced the attack was a provocation carried out by those who want to draw the U.S. into the conflict, but that Washington should show any evidence to the contrary to the United Nations inspectors and the U.N. Security Council.</p> <p>"If there is evidence it should be presented," Putin said. "If it is not presented, that means it does not exist."</p> <p>Russia is one of Syrian President Bashar Assad's staunchest allies. Putin's comments were his first on the crisis since the suspected chemical weapons attack on rebel-held suburbs of Damascus on Aug. 21.</p> <p>The U.N. inspectors spent three days this week touring stricken areas near Damascus and a fourth day interviewing patients at a government-run military hospital. They wrapped up their investigation Friday and left Syria on Saturday, via Lebanon.</p> <p>Later Saturday, the team was en route to the Dutch city of Rotterdam aboard a German government-chartered plane, the German Foreign Ministry said.</p> <p>The experts took blood and urine samples from victims as well as soil samples from the affected areas for examination in laboratories in Europe. The U.N. has said it will try to expedite its final report. U.N. disarmament chief Angela Kane is to brief Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon later Saturday on the investigation.</p> <p>With the inspectors now out of Syria, the looming confrontation between the U.S. and Assad's regime moves one step closer to coming to a head. Most observers viewed U.S. military action as unlikely while the U.N. team was still inside Syria, but the Obama administration has made clear that it is confident in its assessment and could act before the U.N. releases the results of its probe.</p> <p>Obama has said that if he opts for a military strike, any operation would be limited in scope and only aimed at punishing Assad for his alleged use of chemical weapons.</p> <p>But U.S. action carries the potential to trigger retaliation by the Syrian regime or its proxies against U.S. allies in the region, such as Jordan, Turkey and Israel. That would be dangerous new turn for the Syrian civil war, which has already killed more than 100,000 people, forced nearly 2 million to flee and inflamed tensions across the Middle East.</p> <p>While Obama long has been wary of U.S. military involvement in the conflict, the administration on Friday forcefully made its case for action. It accused the Assad regime of carrying out what it says was a chemical attack on Aug. 21 that killed at least 1,429 people -- far more than previous estimates -- including more than 400 children.</p> <p>However, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, one of the main groups monitoring casualties in Syria, said Saturday it has only been able to confirm 502 deaths, identifying victims by name.</p> <p>Its list is based on interviews with hospital officials and activists in the affected areas, said Rami Abdel-Rahman, the head of the Observatory.</p> <p>The Britain-based group, which draws its information from a network of anti-regime activists in Syria, urged the Obama administration to release the information its far higher death toll is based on.</p> <p>With France as his only major public ally, Obama told reporters he has a strong preference for multilateral action.</p> <p>"Frankly, part of the challenge we end up with here is a lot of people think something should be done but nobody wants to do it," he said.</p> <p>The U.S. already has warships in place in the eastern Mediterranean Sea near Syria's coastal waters. The vessels are armed with cruise missiles, long a first-line weapon of choice for presidents because they can strike distant targets without need of air cover or troops on the ground.</p> <p>The Syrian government dismissed the administration's claims as "flagrant lies" akin to faulty Bush administration assertions before the Iraq invasion that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. A Foreign Ministry statement read on state television late Friday said that "under the pretext of protecting the Syrian people, they are making a case for an aggression that will kill hundreds of innocent Syrian civilians."</p> <p>In Damascus, residents braced themselves in anticipation of strikes.</p> <p>"We are anticipating it starting tonight, since the inspectors have left, but we don't really know," said Nour, who lives on the outskirts of Damascus.</p> <p>"Just in case, we stocked up on some water and food. Our building has a basement that we can use as a shelter. The building supervisor started preparing it a couple of days ago, he cleaned it and we put some pillows, blankets, water and a first aid kit with basic medications," said the 23-year-old pharmacy student. She gave only her first name for security reasons.</p> <p>Syrian state TV on Saturday morning broadcast footage of Syrian soldiers training, fighter jets soaring in the sky and tanks firing at unseen targets, all to the backdrop of martial music. The potential U.S. military strike dominated the station's morning talk shows.</p> <p>Obama met with his national security aides at the White House on Friday and then with diplomats from Baltic countries, saying he has not yet made a final decision on punitive strikes.</p> <p>But the administration did nothing to discourage the predictions that action was imminent. That impression was heightened both by sharply worded remarks from Secretary of State John Kerry and the release of an unclassified intelligence assessment that cited "high confidence" that the Syrian government carried out the attack.</p> <p>In addition to the dead, the assessment reported that about 3,600 patients "displaying symptoms consistent with nerve agent exposure" were seen at Damascus-area hospitals after the attack.</p> <p>In his remarks, Kerry added that "a senior regime official who knew about the attack confirmed that chemical weapons were used by the regime, reviewed the impact and actually was afraid they would be discovered."</p> <p>The U.S. assessment did not explain its unexpectedly large count of 1,429 deaths, far in excess of an estimate from Doctors Without Borders from earlier this week that put the toll at 355. Not surprisingly -- given the nature of the disclosure -- it also did not say expressly how the United States knew what one Syrian official had allegedly said to another.</p> <p>Mindful of public opinion, Kerry urged Americans to read the four-page assessment for themselves. He referred to Iraq -- when Bush administration assurances that weapons of mass destruction were present proved false, and a U.S. invasion led to a long, deadly war. Kerry said this time it will be different, and that "we will not repeat that moment."</p> <p>Citing an imperative to act, the secretary of state said "it is directly related to our credibility and whether countries still believe the United States when it says something. They are watching to see if Syria can get away with it because then maybe they, too, can put the world at greater risk."</p> <p>While Obama was having trouble enlisting foreign support, French President Francois Hollande was an exception. The two men spoke by phone, then Hollande issued a statement saying they had "agreed that the international community cannot tolerate the use of chemical weapons, that it must hold the Syrian regime responsible and send a strong message to denounce the use of (such) arms."</p> <p>Obama long has been wary of U.S. military involvement in Syria's civil war, as he has been with tumultuous events elsewhere during the so-called Arab Spring. In the case of Syria, his reluctance stems in part from recognition that while Assad has ties to Iran and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, the rebels seeking to topple him have connections with al-Qaida-linked groups.</p> <p>Still, Obama declared more than a year ago that the use of chemical weapons would amount to a "red line" that Assad should not cross. Obama approved the shipment of small weapons and ammunition to the Syrian rebels after an earlier reported chemical weapons attack, although there is no sign the equipment has arrived.</p> <p>___</p> <p>Associated Press writers Yasmine Saker and Karin Laub in Beirut, and Geir Mouslon in Berlin contributed to this report.</p> <p><br /> Copyright 2013 The Associated Press.

One of them caught the eye of <a href="http://fatlip.leoweekly.com/2013/08/30/women-for-team-mitch/">Joe Sonka</a>, a reporter for the Louisville-based LEO Weekly, who <a href="https://twitter.com/joesonka/status/373439426745364480">posted it on Twitter</a>.</p> <p>The <a href="http://ow.ly/i/314Jv">quote</a>, attributed to a woman named Angela Leet in Jefferson County, read, "Mitch was the co-sponsor of the original Violence Against Women Act- and continues to advocate for stronger policies to protect women. I am proud to call him my senator."</p> <p>The claim belies the Republican leader's actual record.</p> <p>McConnell <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/102/s15">did cosponsor</a> a version of the Violence Against Woman Act in 1991, which never received a Senate vote. But by the time the measure came up again in 1993, McConnell was <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d103:HR3355:">no longer a cosponsor</a>, and in fact <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?midqs=4688595757278691328&congress=103&session=2&vote=00295">voted against</a> final passage of the bill. In 2005, it was renewed by an unrecorded voice vote. In 2012, McConnell <a href="http://livewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/entry/senate-passes-violence-against-women-act-68-31">voted against</a> the Senate-passed VAWA, which <a href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2013/01/why-the-violence-against-women-act-died.php">died in the House</a>. Then early in 2013, he again voted against VAWA re-authorization, which <a href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2013/02/senate-passes-expanded-violence-against-women-act.php">passed the Senate</a> by a vote of 78-22, and eventually passed the House and was signed into law.</p> <p>The minority leader has supported a scaled-back GOP alternative to VAWA which excludes protections for gays, Native Americans and undocumented immigrants who suffer from domestic abuse. Democrats <a href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2013/03/how-house-republicans-caved-on-the-violence-against-women-act.php">strong-armed Republicans</a> into accepting their expanded version.</p> <p>Democratic candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes accused McConnell of deception.</p> <p>"The women of Kentucky will not be fooled by Senator McConnell's failed leadership and deception when it comes to issues important to women and their families," Grimes spokeswoman Charly Norton told TPM. "His actions read loud and clear: McConnell repeatedly voted against equal pay for equal work, the Violence Against Women Act and now turns to lies to cover his shameful record."</p> <p>A McConnell campaign spokesperson didn't respond to requests for comment. At the Louisville event Friday, McConnell <a href="http://mycn2.com/politics/women-for-team-mitch-argue-grimes-approach-toward-women-won-t-work/?p=4667">accused</a> Grimes of adopting "the Barack Obama playbook to try to divide people with gender based attacks. We have seen that all too often and some of it has started already.

ET</em></p> <p>Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce Committee are putting the screws to entities tapped by Obamacare to help Americans sign up and obtain coverage under the law, drawing charges of intimidation and obstruction form the leading Democrat on the panel.</p> <p>The Affordable Care Act provides for $67 million to hire <a href="http://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Programs-and-Initiatives/Health-Insurance-Marketplaces/Downloads/navigator-list-8-15-2013.pdf">105 "Navigators"</a> tasked with helping people learn about their health care options in the law's insurance exchanges and answer questions like whether they're eligible for subsidies or qualify for Medicaid.</p> <p>The Navigators, who were announced by the Department of Health and Human Services on Aug. 15, have become a <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324747104579022733718342984.html">target of suspicion</a> among conservatives, with allegations that liberal groups like Planned Parenthood are the recipient of Navigator grants and that Obama cronies stand to benefit from the arrangement. </p> <p>Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce Committee are now probing whether the Navigators have sufficient training, are protecting patient privacy, have business conflicts of interest, or are being pressured to favor some insurers over others. </p> <p>In a letter dated Aug, 29, 2013, on committee letterhead, 15 Republicans demand documents and responses to questions about Navigator organizations, their workers, their processes of monitoring and supervising employees, their efforts to "safeguard an individual's personal and medicinal information," whether or not they've communicated with a health insurer or provider, and "all documentation and communications related to your Navigator grant."</p> <p>The letter, obtained by TPM, gives the Navigators a Sept. 13 deadline to submit the answers and documents. In addition to Upton, the letter is signed by oversight subcommittee Chairman Tim Murphy (R-PA) and health subcommittee Chairman Joseph Pitts (R-PA), among others. (See the rest of the signatories below.)</p> <p>Rep. Henry Waxman (D-CA), the ranking member on the Energy and Commerce Committee, fired back Friday afternoon in a strongly worded <a href="http://1.usa.gov/15qWn5l">letter</a> to Upton, accusing him of abusing his authority to advance the GOP's "fishing expeditions" against Obamacare.</p> <p>"There is no legitimate predicate for these letters and no evidence of any malfeasance from any of the organizations," he wrote. "It is an abuse of your oversight authority to launch groundless investigations into civic organizations that are trying to make health reform a success. ... I urge you to reconsider these misguided investigations."</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human services called the House GOP investigation "a blatant and shameful attempt to intimidate groups who will be working to inform Americans about their new health insurance options and help them enroll in coverage, just like Medicare counselors have been doing for years."</p> <p>Obamacare expert Tim Jost, a professor at Washington and Lee University who supports the law, explained that most of the Navigator programs "don't have the resources to hire lawyers to fight this, nor the time to respond at this very busy time."</p> <p>The letter was not made public by the Energy and Commerce Committee Republicans who spearheaded it, and a GOP committee spokesperson didn't respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>The success of the Affordable Care Act hinges on whether the insurance exchanges run smoothly. Enrollment begins Oct. 1 and coverage takes effect Jan. 1.</p> <p style=" margin: 12px auto 6px auto; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; -x-system-font: none; display: block;"> <a title="View Navigator Letter on Scribd" href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/164318054/Navigator-Letter" style="text-decoration: underline;" >Navigator Letter</a> by <a title="View tpmdocs's profile on Scribd" href="http://www.scribd.com/tpmdocs" style="text-decoration: underline;" >tpmdocs</a></p><iframe class="scribd_iframe_embed" src="//www.scribd.com/embeds/164318054/content?start_page=1&view_mode=scroll&access_key=key-2hfbk27kohtlnbq6bo62&show_recommendations=true" data-auto-height="false" data-aspect-ratio="0.772922022279349" scrolling="no" id="doc_78280" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe><img width='1' height='1' src='http://talkingpointsmemo.feedsportal.com/c/34753/f/640424/s/309c1efb/sc/30/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><div class='mf-viral'><table border='0'><tr><td valign='middle'><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F08%2Frepublicans-obamacare-navigators.php&t=Republicans+Put+The+Screws+To+Obamacare+%27Navigators%27" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F08%2Frepublicans-obamacare-navigators.php&t=Republicans+Put+The+Screws+To+Obamacare+%27Navigators%27" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F08%2Frepublicans-obamacare-navigators.php&t=Republicans+Put+The+Screws+To+Obamacare+%27Navigators%27" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F08%2Frepublicans-obamacare-navigators.php&t=Republicans+Put+The+Screws+To+Obamacare+%27Navigators%27" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F08%2Frepublicans-obamacare-navigators.php&t=Republicans+Put+The+Screws+To+Obamacare+%27Navigators%27" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png" border="0" /></a></td><td valign='middle'></td></tr></table></div><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173608413223/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/309c1efb/sc/30/rc/1/rc.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173608413223/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/309c1efb/sc/30/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173608413223/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/309c1efb/sc/30/rc/2/rc.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173608413223/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/309c1efb/sc/30/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173608413223/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/309c1efb/sc/30/rc/3/rc.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173608413223/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/309c1efb/sc/30/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173608413223/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/309c1efb/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173608413223/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/309c1efb/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/173608413223/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/309c1efb/a2t.img" border="0"/><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/tpm-news/~4/1TbSKG-1f2Q" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://talkingpointsmemo.feedsportal.com/c/34753/f/640424/s/309c1efb/sc/30/l/0Ltpmdc0Btalkingpointsmemo0N0C20A130C0A80Crepublicans0Eobamacare0Enavigators0Bphp/story01.htm</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>N.M.

The two other clerks of the state's total 33 clerks are already involved in the case. </p> <p>The clerks announced the lawsuit on Thursday. </p> <p>Executive Director of the New Mexico County Clerks Affiliate Daniel Ivey-Soto plans to file a writ of superintending control, a legal mechanism to move the case before the the Supreme Court, on behalf of the intervening clerks in the case. </p> <p>Ivey-Soto, who is also a Democratic New Mexico state senator in addition to leading a nonprofit representing the interests of the clerks, told TPM on Friday that the goal is for the state Supreme Court to issue guidance on whether clerks have to issue licenses to same-sex couples. </p> <p>Over the last week a number of clerks have begun issuing licenses to same-sex couples. Some of those clerks have acted independently while others have begun issuing licenses only after a judge ruled that they had to. Hundreds of same-sex couples have flocked to courthouses in counties where clerks have begun issuing licenses. </p> <p>On Friday, New Mexico's Los Alamos County clerk was <a href="http://livewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/entry/nm-judge-orders-los-alamos-county-clerk-to">ordered</a> to begin issuing licenses or appear before court next week and argue why she should not have to do so. Sharon Stover, the clerk in question, told TPM she is reviewing the order with her attorneys. </p> <p>Since the first clerks began issuing licenses to same-sex couples last week, the question of whether gay marriage is legal in the state has loomed in the background. The state's law is ambiguous, and New Mexico Attorney General Gary King (D) argues that while the law bans gay marriage it also violates constitutional rights. New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez (R) has said that the marriage license issue should be decided by voters and the state's judicial system rather than the county clerks. </p> <p>Specifically, the confusion among the clerks is over the New Mexico statute on the text of marriage licenses. The licenses leave space for a "man" and a "woman" seeking to get married. Some of the clerks who have already issued licenses have printed new licenses that do not specify space for only one man or one woman. </p> <p>New Mexico's Supreme Court has previously refused to hear gay marriage lawsuits before but Ivey-Soto hopes that given the recent developments and that all 33 county clerks (who include both Democrats and Republicans) now want guidance on the licenses, that will motivate the court to get involved. </p> <p>"We're hoping that because we have a case with all 33 clerks and we have an order that applies to all county clerks we're hoping that the Supreme Court says this is the course we're going to and they're going to expedite the process," Ivey-Soto told TPM on Friday.</p> <p>Ivey-Soto said that he and the clerks are trying to move "as expeditiously but as cautiously as possible."</p> <p>Meanwhile, a group of Republican lawmakers in the state legislature are looking into possible legal action to prevent the clerks from continuing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. </p><img width='1' height='1' src='http://talkingpointsmemo.feedsportal.com/c/34753/f/640424/s/309b5ca3/sc/42/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><div class='mf-viral'><table border='0'><tr><td valign='middle'><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F08%2Fnm-county-clerks-seek-guidance-from-state-supreme-court.php&t=N.M.+County+Clerks+Seek+Guidance+From+State+Supreme+Court" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F08%2Fnm-county-clerks-seek-guidance-from-state-supreme-court.php&t=N.M.+County+Clerks+Seek+Guidance+From+State+Supreme+Court" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F08%2Fnm-county-clerks-seek-guidance-from-state-supreme-court.php&t=N.M.+County+Clerks+Seek+Guidance+From+State+Supreme+Court" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F08%2Fnm-county-clerks-seek-guidance-from-state-supreme-court.php&t=N.M.+County+Clerks+Seek+Guidance+From+State+Supreme+Court" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F08%2Fnm-county-clerks-seek-guidance-from-state-supreme-court.php&t=N.M.+County+Clerks+Seek+Guidance+From+State+Supreme+Court" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png" border="0" /></a></td><td valign='middle'></td></tr></table></div><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/174726396256/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/309b5ca3/sc/42/rc/1/rc.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/174726396256/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/309b5ca3/sc/42/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/174726396256/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/309b5ca3/sc/42/rc/2/rc.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/174726396256/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/309b5ca3/sc/42/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/174726396256/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/309b5ca3/sc/42/rc/3/rc.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/174726396256/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/309b5ca3/sc/42/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/174726396256/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/309b5ca3/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/174726396256/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/309b5ca3/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/174726396256/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/309b5ca3/a2t.img" border="0"/><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/tpm-news/~4/QvjazON3k-E" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://talkingpointsmemo.feedsportal.com/c/34753/f/640424/s/309b5ca3/sc/42/l/0Ltpmdc0Btalkingpointsmemo0N0C20A130C0A80Cnm0Ecounty0Eclerks0Eseek0Eguidance0Efrom0Estate0Esupreme0Ecourt0Bphp/story01.htm</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>The White House Makes Its Case Against Syria</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/tpm-news/~3/3dduQ-ia08Y/story01.htm</link><description>In the release of a declassified intelligence brief, a strongly worded public pronouncement from Secretary of State John Kerry, and a background call with reporters, the White House made its formal case Friday for military intervention in Syria.

Some site the risk of doing things. But we need to ask, 'What is the risk of doing nothing?'," Kerry said. "It matters because if we choose to live in the world where a thug and a murderer like Bashar al-Assad can gas thousands of his own people with impunity, even after the United States and our allies said no, and then the world does nothing about it, there will be no end to the test of our resolve and the dangers that will flow from those others who believe that they can do as they will."</p> <p>President Obama said in a later statement Friday afternoon that he had not made a final decision about what course of action to take.</p> <p>In the <a href="http://livewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/entry/us-syrian-chemical-attack-killed-1-429-including?ref=fpblg">four-page intelligence brief</a>, which senior administration officials said was "fully vetted" by the U.S. intelligence community, the U.S. government said that it had "high confidence" that Assad's forces were responsible for the chemical attack, which the administration said killed 1,429 people, including 426 children. "Our high confidence assessment is the strongest position that the U.S. Intelligence Community can take short of confirmation," the government said in the brief.<br /> <br /> The intelligence community assessment documents the Assad regime's chemical weapons capability, reportedly the greatest in the region, and the regime's frustration with being unable to eradicate the Syrian rebels from certain sections of Damascus' suburbs. The intelligence community said it has concluded that the weapons used in the attack were the same ones that the Assad regime had in its possession; that the weapons had been launched from Assad-controlled areas of the city to 12 rebel-controlled neighborhoods, according to satellite images; that regime officials were aware of the attack and, following it, ordered regime units to bombard the rebel areas that had been hit in the attack, according to an interception of the communications of a senior official.</p> <p>That post-attack bombardment was motivated by the regime's concern that United Nations investigators would find evidence of an attack, according to senior administration officials. There were also pre-attack indications, such as the utilization of gas masks, by the regime forces that indicated to U.S. intelligence that an attack was imminent.</p> <p>"We assess that the regime considers chemical weapons in its portfolio of military use," a senior administration official told reporters. "It is not considered an extraordinary measure."</p> <p>Though a Foreign Policy report suggested that the Aug. 21 attack might have been a mistake, senior administration officials stated unequivocally that it was not. When pressed whether Assad had ordered the attack, officials said that Assad is "ultimately in charge of employment" of chemical weapons, but declined to disclose more details.</p> <p>The White House also said it was confident that the Assad regime had initiated smaller-scale chemical weapons attack prior to the events of Aug. 21. Senior administration officials said the White House had verifiable physical evidence of chemical weapons being used in those attacks, but that such evidence had not yet been collected from the Aug. 21 attack. </p> <p>They asserted, though, that the body of other intelligence and the Assad regime's previous use of chemical weapons led to their "high confidence" that chemical weapons had been used in the larger attack.</p> <p>Senior administration officials also indicated that they had other evidence that could not be disclosed, but was being shared with Congress and international partners.</p> <p>The White House is reportedly considering limited air strikes on military targets as retaliation for the Assad regime's use of chemical weapons. Senior administration officials also repeated that the administration is not aiming to achieve a regime change in Syria.</p> <p>Kerry said in his speech and Obama reinforced in his later statement that any intervention would not include "boots on the ground."</p> <p style=" margin: 12px auto 6px auto; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; -x-system-font: none; display: block;"> <a title="View White House Syria Brief on Scribd" href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/164271878/White-House-Syria-Brief" style="text-decoration: underline;" >White House Syria Brief</a> by <a title="View dylantpm's profile on Scribd" href="http://www.scribd.com/dylantpm" style="text-decoration: underline;" >dylantpm</a></p><iframe class="scribd_iframe_embed" src="//www.scribd.com/embeds/164271878/content?start_page=1&view_mode=scroll&access_key=key-1yqxndhoc8bnhmhp6o96&show_recommendations=true" data-auto-height="false" data-aspect-ratio="0.772922022279349" scrolling="no" id="doc_64405" width="600" height="800" frameborder="0"></iframe><img width='1' height='1' src='http://talkingpointsmemo.feedsportal.com/c/34753/f/640424/s/309a6a48/sc/20/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><div class='mf-viral'><table border='0'><tr><td valign='middle'><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F08%2Fthe-white-houses-case-for-war-in-syria.php&t=The+White+House+Makes+Its+Case+Against+Syria" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F08%2Fthe-white-houses-case-for-war-in-syria.php&t=The+White+House+Makes+Its+Case+Against+Syria" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F08%2Fthe-white-houses-case-for-war-in-syria.php&t=The+White+House+Makes+Its+Case+Against+Syria" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F08%2Fthe-white-houses-case-for-war-in-syria.php&t=The+White+House+Makes+Its+Case+Against+Syria" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F08%2Fthe-white-houses-case-for-war-in-syria.php&t=The+White+House+Makes+Its+Case+Against+Syria" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png" border="0" /></a></td><td valign='middle'></td></tr></table></div><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173608409702/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/309a6a48/sc/20/rc/1/rc.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173608409702/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/309a6a48/sc/20/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173608409702/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/309a6a48/sc/20/rc/2/rc.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173608409702/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/309a6a48/sc/20/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173608409702/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/309a6a48/sc/20/rc/3/rc.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173608409702/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/309a6a48/sc/20/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173608409702/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/309a6a48/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173608409702/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/309a6a48/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/173608409702/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/309a6a48/a2t.img" border="0"/><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/tpm-news/~4/3dduQ-ia08Y" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://talkingpointsmemo.feedsportal.com/c/34753/f/640424/s/309a6a48/sc/20/l/0Ltpmdc0Btalkingpointsmemo0N0C20A130C0A80Cthe0Ewhite0Ehouses0Ecase0Efor0Ewar0Ein0Esyria0Bphp/story01.htm</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Budget Talks Collapse Between White House, Senate GOP</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/tpm-news/~3/vwpOMz9k-dQ/story01.htm</link><description>Despite glimmers of hope to the contrary, the era of crisis governance is poised to continue.

Bob Corker (R-TN) said, according to the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/30/us/politics/talks-to-avert-a-fiscal-crisis-in-the-fall-end-with-no-result.html?hpw&_r=0">New York Times</a>. "There's no point in continuing to act as if these discussions are leading some place."</p> <p>Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) backed him up: "In America, you have to believe there's a pathway forward, but right now, I don't see it."</p> <p>The two senators had supported the idea of a budget compromise with a mix of spending cuts and revenues, frustrated with the all-or-nothing ideological approach of more conservative Republicans in both chambers. Senate Democrats had hoped to win over enough GOP members to pass a budget compromise, and pressure House Republicans. President Obama, who began seeking a budget agreement with Senate Republicans months after re-election, has been open to spending cuts -- but only as part of a big, balanced deal that includes revenues. But now those Senate Republicans don't think a deal is possible.</p> <p>What remains unclear is whether the talks broke down because of unresolvable substantive disagreements between those Republican senators and Democrats -- or because neither side could come up with the contours of a deal that would fly with conservatives in the House.</p> <p>For its part, the White House is not willing to throw in the towel quite yet, however.</p> <p>"We appreciated the meeting, which continued the series of candid -- and helpful -- exchanges," a White House official told TPM. "On matters related to the budget, the President has always been clear that closing tax loopholes that benefit the wealthy had to be part of any big deal.

Other GOPers, however, <a href="">have come out</a> and explicitly said they would help citizens navigating the law, saying it is "one of the primary functions of our office."</p> <p>For a law that remains poorly understood by the general public, one's congressional representative seems a likely starting point for getting help. Good luck, if you're in one of the districts whose congressman is taking his or her opposition to Obamacare so far as to refuse any help. But could such tactics actually be unethical, according to the House's own rules? </p> <p>"It's not a frivolous question. There is an ethical standard that calls for members to assist constituents. That's one of their obligations as a member," said David Laufman, former counsel for the House Ethics Committee during the Clinton administration. "There could arguably be a violation, but it's a somewhat nebulous area."</p> <p>The House Ethics Manual, last updated in 2008 but still the functioning ethics guidance, includes this catch-all phrase: </p> <blockquote>Members, officers, and employees of the House should: Conduct themselves at all times in a manner that reflects creditably on the House.</blockquote> <p>That would be the broad standard House Republicans are arguably breaching if they refuse to assist constituents looking for help in accessing federal benefits, Laufman told TPM in a phone interview. But based on historical precedents, it would be unlikely for such obstructionism to lead to an investigation without an egregious set of circumstances, Laufman added. </p> <p>Other experts agreed that it would take more than refusal to help on this one program for a Congress member's conduct to be considered a genuine ethics violation. (They also questioned whether those representatives would actually live up to their promise not to help on Obamacare.)</p> <p>"I'm sure constituents don't get help from their representatives all the time. You'd have to have particular circumstances: 'I am going to state categorically that I'm not going to help you in any way.' I don't think any of them are actually going to do that," Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Ethics and Responsibility in Washington, a watchdog group, and former assistant U.S. attorney, told TPM in a phone interview. "But it is incredibly dumb. Who advertises their lack of constituent services?"</p> <p>Another section of the Ethics Manual does point to a specific set of circumstances in which there could be an obvious ethics violation if a House member refused to help their constituents with the law:</p> <blockquote>A Member's responsibility in this area is to all his constituents equally and should be pursued with diligence irrespective of political or other considerations.</blockquote> <p>That language is generally intended to prohibit lawmakers of one party from discriminating against constituents of the opposite party. So if a constituent called, asking for help getting benefits under Obamacare while making clear their support for the law, and a House member refused them on narrow partisan grounds, that would be a much more serious ethical red flag, Laufman said.</p> <p>"If a constituent wanted a member's help in contacting (the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services), and the member said, 'Screw you, you didn't vote for me,' that would be potentially improper, if the member were offering services to Republican constituents," he said.</p> <p>Craig Holman, a government affairs lobbyist with nonpartisan but progressive watchdog Public Citizen, wrote to TPM in an email that public declarations by House members that they won't help constituents access benefits available to them under federal law is largely unprecedented.</p> <p>"I have never heard of lawmakers refusing to assist constituents," he said. "The obsession with sabotaging Obamcare shown by some congressional Republicans in their stated unwillingness to assist constituents is not so much a violation of House ethics rules as it is an abrogation of their oath to serve as a faithful representative." </p> <p>"Turning one's back on constituents and refusing to help them is much more a sign of unfitness for public office, and constituents are going to see that," Holman said.</p> <p>Even if House Republicans are walking up to that ethical line -- but not quite crossing it -- it may not matter if the Ethics Committee will never call them on it. </p> <p>"The Ethics Committee typically doesn't police in minutiae the manner in which members assist their constituents or whether they did a good job," Laufman said. "They just don't want to engage in that kind of police oversight over the quality of a member's casework."</p><img width='1' height='1' src='http://talkingpointsmemo.feedsportal.com/c/34753/f/640424/s/30989278/sc/7/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><div class='mf-viral'><table border='0'><tr><td valign='middle'><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F08%2Fobstructing-obamacare-unethical-but-not-an-ethics-violation.php&t=Does+Refusing+To+Help+Constituents+With+Obamacare+Cross+An+Ethical+Line%3F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F08%2Fobstructing-obamacare-unethical-but-not-an-ethics-violation.php&t=Does+Refusing+To+Help+Constituents+With+Obamacare+Cross+An+Ethical+Line%3F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F08%2Fobstructing-obamacare-unethical-but-not-an-ethics-violation.php&t=Does+Refusing+To+Help+Constituents+With+Obamacare+Cross+An+Ethical+Line%3F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F08%2Fobstructing-obamacare-unethical-but-not-an-ethics-violation.php&t=Does+Refusing+To+Help+Constituents+With+Obamacare+Cross+An+Ethical+Line%3F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F08%2Fobstructing-obamacare-unethical-but-not-an-ethics-violation.php&t=Does+Refusing+To+Help+Constituents+With+Obamacare+Cross+An+Ethical+Line%3F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png" border="0" /></a></td><td valign='middle'></td></tr></table></div><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173953216171/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30989278/sc/7/rc/1/rc.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173953216171/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30989278/sc/7/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173953216171/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30989278/sc/7/rc/2/rc.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173953216171/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30989278/sc/7/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173953216171/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30989278/sc/7/rc/3/rc.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173953216171/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30989278/sc/7/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173953216171/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30989278/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173953216171/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30989278/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/173953216171/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/30989278/a2t.img" border="0"/><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/tpm-news/~4/chmfmdMbaGs" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://talkingpointsmemo.feedsportal.com/c/34753/f/640424/s/30989278/sc/7/l/0Ltpmdc0Btalkingpointsmemo0N0C20A130C0A80Cobstructing0Eobamacare0Eunethical0Ebut0Enot0Ean0Eethics0Eviolation0Bphp/story01.htm</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Is This The Beginning Of The End Of The War On Drugs?</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/tpm-news/~3/4zx0L468YHI/story01.htm</link><description>It's America's 40-year war.

From Nixon through Nancy -- "Just Say No!" -- to Clinton not inhaling. From coke to crack to meth. </p> <p>Throughout the War on Drugs, the drive has been for more law enforcement, stiffer sentences and less tolerance. The limitations of interdiction and incarceration are well-documented. But the push for harsher penalties rarely abated, and the emphasis remained on drugs as a criminal matter for law enforcment. Until Thursday, when the first real retreat of any kind was made official. </p> <p>The Justice Department's <a href="http://livewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/entry/doj-wont-sue-colorado-washington-over-marijuana-legalization?ref=fpb">announcement</a> that it would not block Colorado and Washington from implementing state laws legalizing marijuana marked a sea change.</p> <p>There are a lot of caveats. The Justice Department included a long list of demands that those states must meet in order to avoid federal intervention. Advocates quickly point out the Obama administration's previous assurances that it wouldn't interfere with medical marijuana hasn't stopped federal agents from raiding operations that they say conflict with federal and state laws. How individual U.S. attorneys react will be crucial -- one in Washington actually <a href="http://www.dailyjournal.net/view/story/2f56238d194f4a309188a215de990ed9/WA--Legalizing-Marijuana-Wash/#.Uh--QWSDTx4">alleged</a> after the announcement that her state's medical marijuana system violated the new guidance.</p> <p>But it's still a big deal. This is the federal government acknowledging that, within a specific set of parameters, a Schedule I narcotic under the 1978 Controlled Substances Act (effectively the legal foundation for the War) can be fully legalized. That's a complete reversal of federal policy since 1971, when President Richard Nixon first declared war on drugs.</p> <p>"This is a big deal. This really is a dramatic departure from the earlier enforcement of state marijuana laws," Robert Mikos, a law professor at Vanderbilt University, told TPM. "It could portend larger changes with respect to the war on marijuana. It could also embolden legalization efforts in a lot more states. That could end up being the biggest ramifications, that political shift."</p> <p>Last week, a poll <a href="http://livewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/entry/poll-82-of-americans-think-our-war-on">found</a> that 82 percent of Americans believe the nation is losing the War on Drugs. That same poll found a majority agreed with a decision by Attorney General Eric Holder to reduce the number of mandatory minimum sentences for drug convictions, another important shift in federal policy. It reflects a belief among advocates, one <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/health/2012/06/12/497731/drug-addiction-public-health-issue/">endorsed</a> by the White House itself, that drug addiction should be viewed more as a public health issue than a criminal one. In their mind, that's the end game for the War.</p> <p>Others were more tempered in their response. Mark Kleiman, a public policy professor at UCLA who focuses on drug policy, said that the memo was effectively what he was expecting. It still leaves enforcement decisions to the discretion of individual officials -- as the Washington U.S. attorney's pronouncement reinforced -- and there's enough rhetorical wiggle room for federal agents that businesses and users could still be targeted for prosecution. </p> <p>"The (November 2012 voter) initiatives mark an epoch in drug policy reform, and it seems to me that this is a modest accommodation," Kleiman told TPM. "But they are making it clear that they respect state enforcement systems. That's a big deal."</p> <p>Advocates, for their part, were jubilant, seizing the announcement as a historical shift in federal policy.</p> <p>"The war on drugs I would expect will end today," Terry Nelson, a retired U.S. customs and border protection agent who now works with Law Enforcement Against Prohibition, which supports legalization, told TPM in a phone interview. "Once the floodgates open, and states see that the federal government is not going to prosecute, then this could be the day that we could say we won this war."</p> <p>It should be noted that the Justice Department's pronouncement represented a fundamental change in how the federal government approaches marijuana only -- the trafficking of harder drugs like heroin and cocaine will still likely be as vigorously prosecuted as they are now. But even on those drugs, Holder's sentencing guidance represents a recent reevaluation in how the federal government views its role.</p> <p>The changes in marijuana policy are seismic, though, Vanderbilt's Mikos said. The Justice Department named very narrow interests in which it wants to crack down on marijuana: keeping it out of the hands of minors, stopping it from crossing state borders and preventing marijuana sales from funding other criminal activity. As importantly, the federal government acknowledged that there could be legal forms of marijuana trafficking, as long it complies with state regulations.</p> <p>Recent polling has started to routinely show that a slim majority of Americans support marijuana legalization. Thursday's announcement could encourage that movement. The Marijuana Policy Project, one of the major policy organizations on the topic, has <a href="http://www.mpp.org/about/strategic-plan-2013.html">set its sights</a> on legalization in Rhode Island, Alaska, Oregon, Maine and California in the next year.</p> <p>There are also those who warn that the Justice Department is a fundamental mistake, rife with potential for unintended consequences. But even they agreed with its historical significance.</p> <p>"This President will be remembered for many failures, but none as large as this one, which will lead to massive youth drug use, destruction of community values, increased addiction and crime rates," Paul Chabot, a drug policy advisor for the Clinton and Bush White Houses, wrote to TPM in an email. "America may never recover."</p><img width='1' height='1' src='http://talkingpointsmemo.feedsportal.com/c/34753/f/640424/s/3096c9ae/sc/7/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><div class='mf-viral'><table border='0'><tr><td valign='middle'><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F08%2Fthe-war-on-drugs-1971-2013.php&t=Is+This+The+Beginning+Of+The+End+Of+The+War+On+Drugs%3F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F08%2Fthe-war-on-drugs-1971-2013.php&t=Is+This+The+Beginning+Of+The+End+Of+The+War+On+Drugs%3F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F08%2Fthe-war-on-drugs-1971-2013.php&t=Is+This+The+Beginning+Of+The+End+Of+The+War+On+Drugs%3F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F08%2Fthe-war-on-drugs-1971-2013.php&t=Is+This+The+Beginning+Of+The+End+Of+The+War+On+Drugs%3F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F08%2Fthe-war-on-drugs-1971-2013.php&t=Is+This+The+Beginning+Of+The+End+Of+The+War+On+Drugs%3F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png" border="0" /></a></td><td valign='middle'></td></tr></table></div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/tpm-news/~4/4zx0L468YHI" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://talkingpointsmemo.feedsportal.com/c/34753/f/640424/s/3096c9ae/sc/7/l/0Ltpmdc0Btalkingpointsmemo0N0C20A130C0A80Cthe0Ewar0Eon0Edrugs0E19710E20A130Bphp/story01.htm</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Heritage's Fun With 'Defund Obamacare' Polling Numbers</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/tpm-news/~3/PYIMGTvOm04/story01.htm</link><description>The Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank that has been a leader in the Defund Obamacare movement, appeared to go through a small crisis in the last 24 hours over just what percentage of Americans support their cause.

That same morning, the Kaiser Family Foundation, one of the most respected health policy think tanks, released a monthly tracking poll that found the exact opposite: 57 percent of Americans opposed defunding the health care reform law.</p> <p>As one would expect, liberal commentators called them out on it.</p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Dude, that&#39;s the exact OPPOSITE of what the poll says <a href="http://t.co/JiMRCkooJ8">http://t.co/JiMRCkooJ8</a> RT <a href="https://twitter.com/Heritage">@Heritage</a>: Are you part of the 57%? <a href="http://t.co/Olnw5hxSmV">http://t.co/Olnw5hxSmV</a></p>&#8212; Judd Legum (@JuddLegum) <a href="https://twitter.com/JuddLegum/statuses/372828798141878272">August 28, 2013</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> <p>Here's the original poster, for reference:</p> <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Heritage poster.jpg" src="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/Images/Heritage%20poster.jpg" width="600" height="600" class="mt-image-none" style="" /></span></p> <p>Thursday morning, the Heritage Twitter account tweeted the poster again. Again, they drew the ire of the liberal Twitterati.</p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Actual poll: 57% DISAPPROVE cutting off funding. <a href="http://t.co/JwBprc4Xl9">http://t.co/JwBprc4Xl9</a> RT <a href="https://twitter.com/Heritage">@Heritage</a>: Are you? <a href="http://t.co/ydFrh9qnVs">http://t.co/ydFrh9qnVs</a></p>&#8212; igorvolsky (@igorvolsky) <a href="https://twitter.com/igorvolsky/statuses/373050074655240193">August 29, 2013</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> <p>At that point, TPM reached out to the foundation's communications staff and former Sen. Jim DeMint, now its director, for clarity on the apparent contradiction.</p> <p>They never returned TPM's calls, but a few hours later, both of the previous tweets had been deleted. Heritage then tweeted a new poster at about 12:30 p.m.:</p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>An updated version: <a href="http://t.co/nC7k17CvMK">pic.twitter.com/nC7k17CvMK</a></p>&#8212; Heritage Foundation (@Heritage) <a href="https://twitter.com/Heritage/statuses/373120878529097730">August 29, 2013</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> <p>See the difference? There is now a citation of a August 7-8 poll by Basswood Research, which Heritage's advocacy arm co-sponsored. That poll found 57 percent of independent voters in 10 key congressional districts favored defunding Obamacare.</p> <p>That's the same poll, mind you, that conservative Washington Post blogger Jennifer Rubin <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2013/08/15/heritages-junk-poll/">called</a> a "junk poll." From Rubin:</p> <blockquote>I have made the case that the Heritage Foundation and its sister institution Heritage Action have left intellectual integrity and political sanity behind in the rush for visibility and fundraising bucks. There is no better example of that than some terribly dishonest polling done to promote the fruitless effort to defund Obamacare by threatening to shut down the government.</blockquote> <p>After being told that TPM was writing a story on the discrepancy, Mike Gonzalez, vice president of communications at Heritage, reached out to TPM. He asserted that the poster was never intended to reference the Kaiser poll, though it was released on the same day as that poll was making headlines. It was, he said, always a reference to the Basswood poll, and they wanted to make that clear. In fairness to Heritage, they did <a href="http://heritageaction.com/press-releases/poll-house-majority-not-at-stake-over-defund-of-obamacare/">trumpet</a> the Basswood poll when it was released.</p> <p>"I wanted to thank you for the tip, but the assumption you made is wrong.

Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), a freshman congresswoman who House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has described as a "<a href="http://www.civilbeat.com/articles/2012/09/13/17069-what-does-tulsi-gabbards-rising-star-do-for-hawaii/">rising star</a>."</p> <p>According to the FBI and U.S. Capitol Police, Sherbow's arrest was a result of unspecified threats made earlier this month. However, Sherbow has a history with Gabbard that began with their apparent ties to a controversial Hare Krishna sect in Hawaii and most recently peaked with him vowing to cut off her head.</p> <p>A <a href="http://livewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/entry/fugitive-arrested-in-mexico-for-allegedly-threatening-rep">press release issued by the FBI and Capitol Police</a> said Sherbow was arrested in Tijuana on Wednesday pursuant to a U.S. arrest warrant for the "charge of transmission of threats in interstate commerce. The FBI and Capitol Police said the "alleged threats occurred on August 1 and August 3, 2013 and were deemed credible."</p> <p>According to a story by the news website Hawaii Reporter earlier this month, Sherbow <a href="http://www.hawaiireporter.com/former-resident-threats-to-decapitate-hawaii-congresswoman/123">sent an email</a> to the FBI on Aug. 2 in which he threatened to decapitate Gabbard. </p> <p>"I, Aniruddha Sherbow, with the Divine as my witness, do hereby solemnly vow to find Tulsi Gabbard, wheresoever she may be, and to sever her head from her body," Sherbow wrote, according to an excerpt of the email published by the Hawaii Reporter. </p> <p>In a <a href="http://www.hawaiireporter.com/man-who-threatened-to-decapitate-hawaii-congresswoman-is-captured-in-mexico/123">follow-up story on Sherbow's arrest</a>, published Thursday, Hawaii Reporter said it had exclusively corresponded with Sherbow in a "series of emails" in which he detailed the reasons behind his anger at Gabbard. Sherbow described her as a "Prima Donna" who made him feel "insignificant" and said he offered to volunteer for Gabbard when she was a member of the Honolulu City Council. Gabbard served on the council from 2011 until 2012 before resigning to run for Congress. </p> <p>In March 2011, a district court <a href="http://www.staradvertiser.com/news/20110325__Court_orders_man_to_stop_harassing_councilwoman.html?id=118639559">issued a three-year injunction</a> against Sherbow, barring him from contacting or threatening Gabbard. According to the Honolulu Star Advertiser, Gabbard said Sherbow <a href="http://www.staradvertiser.com/news/20110325__Court_orders_man_to_stop_harassing_councilwoman.html?id=118639559">contacted her more than 35 times</a> over a less-than-three-week period, including communications that were "extremely inappropriate, profane, vulgar and sexual in nature." Gabbard said Sherbow first contacted her asking to rent office space from her. </p> <p>After weeks of texting Gabbard, Sherbow allegedly <a href="http://www.staradvertiser.com/news/20110325__Court_orders_man_to_stop_harassing_councilwoman.html?id=118639559">showed up to a city council meeting</a> where Gabbard was in attendance. Police spoke to him at the meeting, which Gabbard said caused him to send her an angry text message. Sherbow was arrested March 4, 2011 and charged with harassment. </p> <p>Sherbow <a href="http://www.hawaiireporter.com/former-resident-threats-to-decapitate-hawaii-congresswoman/123">told the Hawaii Reporter</a> he initially approached Gabbard because he "was born into the same obscure Western-Hindu tradition as Tulsi, the Hare Krishna Movement, also known as the Brahma Madhva-Gaudiya Sampradaya."</p> <p>"Because of this last connection, I think she is counting on me not hurting her. And she is right to count on it, because it is in fact very difficult for me to hurt her. However, we all have our limits, and I have reached mine," Sherbow wrote. "At this point, if you stuck Tulsi's head in front of me, I'd have it off in two seconds flat."</p> <p>Gabbard's parents reportedly have extensive ties to a splinter Hare Krishna sect led by a guru named Chris Butler. This Hawaii-based group, which has variously been known as the <a href="http://www.chrisbutlerspeaks.org/">Hare Name Society, Identity Institute and the Science of Identity Foundation</a> has sparked controversy over the years and is <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=rick+ross+institute&oq=rick+ross+institute&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l3.5323j0&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#q=chris+butler+cult">is sometimes described</a> as a cult. The links between Gabbard's family and Butler's sect were detailed in a 2004 <a href="http://www.honolulumagazine.com/Honolulu-Magazine/August-2004/Who-is-Mike-Gabbard/">Honolulu Magazine profile</a> of the congresswoman's father, Mike Gabbard, who is a member of the Hawaii state Senate and former councilman and who fought efforts to legalize gay marriage in Hawaii. </p> <p>In forums on the website Topix.com, a user identified as Aniruddha Sherbow described being accused of threatening Gabbard in a series of messages dated July 2012. In one of those postings, Sherbow <a href="http://www.topix.com/forum/city/honolulu-hi/TIDA4QH78M1TU53O7">also discussed his relationship to Butler's group</a>. </p> <p>"I was born into ISKCON," wrote Sherbow, referring to the International Society for Krishna Consiciousness, which is the group Butler was <a href="http://www.chrisbutlerspeaks.org/about-chris-butler.html">initially affiliated with</a>. "Don't have much to do with it anymore though."</p> <p>The nature of Tulsi Gabbard's ties to Butler's group are less clear. In its profile of the congresswoman's father, Honolulu Magazine noted he described himself as Catholic. When Honolulu Magazine asked the elder Gabbard about his ties to Butler's Hare Krishna sect, the publication said it <a href="http://www.honolulumagazine.com/Honolulu-Magazine/August-2004/Who-is-Mike-Gabbard/">received a reply from Tulsi Gabbard</a> accusing them of pursuing the story because they opposed her father's work fighting same-sex marriage. </p> <p>"I smell a skunk," Tulsi Gabbard wrote, according to the magazine. "It's clear to me that you're acting as a conduit for The Honolulu Weekly and other homosexual extremist supporters of Ed Case."</p> <p>Hare Krishna is based on Hindu scriptures including the Bhagavad Gita. Gabbard describes herself as Hindu and, in January, she was <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/04/tulsi-gabbard-hindu-bhagavad-gita-swearing-in_n_2410078.html">sworn in on the Bhagavad Gita</a>. Gabbard said she chose the book because it led her on a "spiritual journey." </p> <p>"I was raised in a multiracial, multicultural, multi-faith family. My mother is Hindu; my father is a Catholic lector in his church who also practices mantra meditation. I began to grapple with questions of spirituality as a teenager," Gabbard said, according to the Huffington Post. "Over time, I came to believe that, at its essence, religion gives us a deeper purpose in life than just living for ourselves. Since I was a teenager, I embraced this spiritual journey through the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita."</p> <p>Gabbard's spokeswoman, Heather Fluit, did not respond to a question from TPM Thursday about whether the congresswoman identifies as either a Hare Krishna or a follower of Butler. </p> <p>Sherbow evidently had hard feelings about his initial arrest for allegedly harassing Gabbard. He <a href="http://www.hawaiireporter.com/former-resident-threats-to-decapitate-hawaii-congresswoman/123">told the Hawaii Reporter</a> he was forced to leave the U.S. because of newspaper coverage of the case and said Gabbard misrepresented the incident. </p> <p>"You know, what she did basically took my entire life, and it has had repercussions all around me, to everyone connected to me," Sherbow told the Reporter. "I want my life back, I don't like being tortured, and I don't like those connected to me having to suffer. Lastly, it's worth mentioning that I don't think people elected her to character assassinate people, or to pick on people. She is in a trusted position."</p> <p>Sherbow <a href="http://www.topix.com/forum/city/honolulu-hi/T5S28NCK2JFNUK3EU">described similar gripes on Topix</a>. In a July 2012 posting entitled, "Tulsi Gabbard has Committed a 'Felony in Office,'" Sherbow accused Gabbard of lying about him.</p> <p>"I publicly accuse Tulsi Gabbard of having committed a 'Felony in Office,' namely the crime of perjury. I tried to help her about a year ago, and I criticized her for not being responsive, something which many people have commented about," Sherbow wrote. "Anyways, she made up a bunch of crap about me being physical threat because she knows that's all the cops care about. I got arrested, people were after me, I left Hawaii, etc. She's had a year to put things straight, and has done absolutely nothing. Now it's gotten to the point where many others are being affected, because they believe, and I cannot help them." </p> <p>Sherbow also argued Gabbard should be forced out of politics. </p> <p>"She's been getting tons of praise and accolades. She is completely undeserving of any of them," wrote Sherbow. "She has shamelessly abused the trust that the people placed in her. Now she should go get a real job."</p> <p>Gabbard's spokeswoman, Fluit, declined to comment on Sherbow Thursday.</p> <p>"We do not have comment on the arrest, but the congresswoman is grateful for the work of the U.S. Capitol Police, FBI, and all law enforcement officers involved in this investigation," Fluit wrote in an email to TPM. </p> <p>Fluit referred TPM to the Capitol Police for any "additional questions." A spokesman for the Capitol Police said they could not provide any information on the arrest beyond what was in the initial press release.</p><img width='1' height='1' src='http://talkingpointsmemo.feedsportal.com/c/34753/f/640424/s/3090b66f/sc/11/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><div class='mf-viral'><table border='0'><tr><td valign='middle'><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F08%2Faniruddha_sherbow_tulsi_gabbard.php&t=Horrifying+Threats+Against+Congresswoman+Tied+To+Obscure+Hare+Krishna+Sect" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F08%2Faniruddha_sherbow_tulsi_gabbard.php&t=Horrifying+Threats+Against+Congresswoman+Tied+To+Obscure+Hare+Krishna+Sect" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F08%2Faniruddha_sherbow_tulsi_gabbard.php&t=Horrifying+Threats+Against+Congresswoman+Tied+To+Obscure+Hare+Krishna+Sect" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F08%2Faniruddha_sherbow_tulsi_gabbard.php&t=Horrifying+Threats+Against+Congresswoman+Tied+To+Obscure+Hare+Krishna+Sect" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com%2F2013%2F08%2Faniruddha_sherbow_tulsi_gabbard.php&t=Horrifying+Threats+Against+Congresswoman+Tied+To+Obscure+Hare+Krishna+Sect" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png" border="0" /></a></td><td valign='middle'></td></tr></table></div><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173953187615/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/3090b66f/sc/11/rc/1/rc.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173953187615/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/3090b66f/sc/11/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173953187615/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/3090b66f/sc/11/rc/2/rc.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173953187615/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/3090b66f/sc/11/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173953187615/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/3090b66f/sc/11/rc/3/rc.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173953187615/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/3090b66f/sc/11/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173953187615/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/3090b66f/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/173953187615/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/3090b66f/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/173953187615/u/49/f/640424/c/34753/s/3090b66f/a2t.img" border="0"/><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/tpm-news/~4/Ce8RgGs_Ntc" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://talkingpointsmemo.feedsportal.com/c/34753/f/640424/s/3090b66f/sc/11/l/0Ltpmmuckraker0Btalkingpointsmemo0N0C20A130C0A80Caniruddha0Isherbow0Itulsi0Igabbard0Bphp/story01.htm</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>China To Launch Unmanned Lunar Lander By Year-End</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/tpm-news/~3/ZJ0iqKuXL1c/story01.htm</link><description>4:22pm ET BEIJING (AP) -- China said Wednesday it will launch its first unmanned lunar lander by the end of this year, complete with a radio-controlled rover to transmit images and dig into the moon's surface to test samples.

Launched in 2011, the station is due to be replaced by a three-module permanent station, Tiangong 2, in seven years.</p> <p>China sent its first astronaut into space in 2003, becoming the third nation after Russia and the United States to achieve manned space travel independently. The military-backed space program is a source of enormous national pride and has powered ahead in a series of well-funded, methodically timed steps.</p> <p><br /> Copyright 2013 The Associated Press.
